(AP) -- Students returned to classes at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls.
Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed when two gunmen burst into the Jefferson County school wielding guns and bombs.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves.
