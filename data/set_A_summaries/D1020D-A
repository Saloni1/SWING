A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary, Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich., began on Dec. 22.
When ingested, Listeria bacteria can cause illness and death among the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and those with weakened immune systems.
(AP) -- A meat processing plant is voluntarily recalling all frankfurter and lunch combination products it produced since July 6 because they may be contaminated.
But some state public health officials say the outbreak could have been contained sooner had the Agriculture Department done its job.
The meat was under test by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
