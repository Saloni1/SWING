0_1	0.24636508	The spectacular collapse of a towering crane on the East Side began when a massivepiece of steel designed to secure it to a new high-rise building came loose and pancaked on top of a second support nine stories below, shearing it free and creating a fatal imbalance that sent the 22-story crane toppling across a two- block swath of Turtle Bay, officials said Sunday.
0_2	0.1157536	Officials were focusing their investigation in part on the way the steel piece -- called a "collar" -- was being installed, including whether a series of hoists and nylon straps used to hold it temporarily in place were strong enough to sustain its weight, said Patricia J. Lancaster, the buildings commissioner.
0_3	0.081301159	Building officials estimated the weight at 12,000 pounds.
0_4	0.33638249	Meanwhile, work crews and rescuers swarmed over the site of the disaster, on 51st Street and 50th Street just east of Second Avenue.
0_5	0.21776548	They began to remove portions of the broken crane's white lattice tower, one leaning against a 19-story building on 51st Street and another, which had broken off and tumbled through the air, lying across a demolishedfour-story town house on 50th Street.
0_6	0.24918139	Four construction workers -- a crane operator and three riggers who were helping to "jump" the crane, or increase its height -- were killed.
0_7	0.12495715	Three people were missing.
0_8	0.12563374	On Sunday, as hope dwindled, firefighters, including a unit that specializes in building collapses, continued to search for signs of life.
0_9	0.11464998	"We're still calling it a search operation, though with each passing hour, things are getting more grim," said Nicholas Scoppetta, the fire commissioner.
0_10	0.43729745	Speaking at a news conference near the scene, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said 24 people were injured.
0_11	0.40416025	Buildings Department officials said construction on the building had been halted while the investigation continued.
0_12	0.070731738	"As far as we can tell, all procedures that were called for were being followed, but it's much too early to make a definitive decision," Bloomberg said.
0_13	0.03504846	"We will look to see whether or not there was human error or mechanical error or whether or not our procedures just aren't adequate.

0_15	0.21214131	On Saturday, hundreds of workers boiled about the site, and several other cranes were brought in to help lift heavy sections of latticed steel from the toppled crane.
0_16	0.045725225	Meanwhile, dozens of onlookers gazed from behind metal barricades on Second Avenue.
0_17	0.33312361	At the site of the demolished town house, which had a bar called Fubar in the ground floor and apartments above, ironworkers cut up sections of the toppled crane and removed pieces of the building.
0_18	0.13974396	Each time they cleared a section of the rubble, rescue workers descended on a ladder and then crawled farther into the collapsed ruins, armed with listening devices to search for signs of life.
0_19	0.16347127	Red Cross workers handed out coffee to rescue workers at the site while a Starbucks at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue gave out free coffee.
0_20	0.091672533	Seventeen buildings were evacuated, and most people were still not able to get inside.
0_21	0.14305653	One man, however, was given 10 minutes to dash into his apartment in the building at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue, which was damaged in the disaster, to retrieve his pet guinea pig.
0_22	0.067510594	The man, Seth Shearer, 24, said he persuaded officials to let him inside because he was scheduled to leave town on vacation and would not be able to get the animal until later.
0_23	0.064670792	Most people who had been displaced found lodging with relatives or made other arrangements.
0_24	0.15807913	Several streets in the area remained closed, and officials said they hoped to have at least one lane of Second Avenue opened by Monday morning.
0_25	0.1325922	The disaster occurred at 2:22 p.m. on Saturday, a day workers on the high-rise condominium under construction at 303 E. 51st St. had spent adding two or more 13-foot sections to increase the crane's height, a process known as "jumping" or "climbing" the crane.
0_26	0.10679308	By the time they were done, the crane's tower had reached a height of more than 200 feet, or about 20 stories.
0_27	0.090839765	That structure was topped by a cab and jib extending farther.
0_28	0.17516473	At that point, the workers turned to the process of bracing the crane by positioning a steel collar around the outside of the crane's tower at the building's 18th floor.
0_29	0.15968523	The collar, which officials said weighed about 12,000 pounds and was made of two U-shaped pieces of steel joined together, was to be secured to the tower and then tied by steel struts to the building.
0_30	0.1022925	As the work progressed, the collar was suspended high above the ground from metal hoists, known as chain blocks, connected to a higher section of the steel tower with slings made of thick nylon webbing, according to a person involved in the recovery.
0_31	0.094849384	But as workers were maneuvering the collar into place, it broke free and plummeted down the crane's tower, like a ring around a steel tube sliding down.
0_32	0.11047909	It slammed into another collar already in place at the ninth floor, shearing it from the struts that held it to the building and carrying it down to smash into yet another collar at the third floor.
0_33	0.10313433	Unmoored and unbalanced, the spindly structure teetered and fell, the heavy cab and counterweights at the top pulling it down onto the buildings to the south.
0_34	0.094473515	Lancaster said investigators were looking at how the collar was being maneuvered into place just before it fell and whether theslings might have broken.
0_35	0.08976593	She said investigators would try to determine whether the slings were worn or damaged or if they were strong enough to hold the collar's weight.
0_36	0.11675369	The person involved in the recovery provided a photograph of the collapsed collar showing one of the nylon straps still attached with what appeared to be a frayed and broken end.
0_37	0.10439669	Lancaster also said the position of the cab, with its approximately 40 tons of counterbalances, might have contributed to the disaster.
0_38	0.13375284	"The counterweight was pointing south, and so it pulled the crane away from the building," she said.
0_39	0.14613112	"If it had been pointing north, it would have pulled the crane into the building."
0_40	0.13024396	Scrutiny Sunday was also on the developer and the contractors involved in the work.
0_41	0.13311894	The crane was owned by New York Crane &amp; Equipment Corp., but it had apparently been leased to one of the contractors involved in the project.
0_42	0.15126128	Lancaster said the company in charge of the crane was an Elizabeth, N.J., subcontractor on the construction project known as Joy Contractors Inc., identified as JCI in Building Department documents.
0_43	0.097389773	Lancaster said her agency was still determining what other construction jobs JCI was involved in.
0_44	0.097225818	The crane installation was designed and approved by Peter J. Stroh, an engineer based in West Babylon, N.Y., according to a permit issued for the equipment in January.
0_45	0.12764268	Stroh's company was helping Sunday with the removal of a crane piece that lay tilted against an apartment house on 51st Street, opposite the construction site, according to officials.
0_46	0.097503866	The lead developer on the project was James P. Kennelly, a retired firefighter with a law degree who branched out into real estate.
0_47	0.10015235	He has done about two dozen projects since he opened his own development company in the mid-1980s, but the building on East 51st, which is to rise to 43 stories, with 180 condominium apartments, was by far the largest.
0_48	0.10501414	The biggest building he had built before was a 14-story apartment building on East 30th Street in Manhattan.
0_49	0.10248809	Kennelly issued a statement Saturday saying he had instructed his construction manager, Reliance Construction Group, known as RCG, to cooperate with investigators.
0_50	0.098160887	"We're devastated by this tragedy, and our prayers are with the families," he said in the statement.
0_51	0.13122052	Saturday's accident was the most recent of several high-profile construction accidents that have come during a building boom in the city.
0_52	0.099910909	The number of construction permits for new buildings or major renovations issued by the Buildings Department has soared 23.3 percent over the past five years, rising to 86,915 in 2007 from 70,515 in 2002.

9_19	0.089807508	"We thought about it, and we think if it falls, it will probably fall into the park or bounce off that clock tower," said Jarrod Shandley, 25, who lives with two roommates in a penthouse that looks out onto a crane at East 23rd Street and Madison Avenue.
9_20	0.12360761	Boom, jib, cab -- cranes have their own New York vernacular.
9_21	0.13506093	Like New Yorkers, they come in all shapes and sizes, but the ones that dominate in Manhattan are tower cranes, which are used in the construction of tall buildings.
9_22	0.10168791	Still, Sunday, virtually every crane in the city -- no matter its safety record or soundness -- was looked upon with skepticism by many pedestrians and residents.
9_23	0.19989271	Yet, it was perhaps a testament to the city's reliance upon cranes that workers at the accident site were using other cranes to stabilize and assess the one that toppled.
9_24	0.23283379	At East 23rd Street, the giant white crane fixed to the building under construction was the talk of the neighborhood.
9_25	0.12144388	Lynn Catanio, 56, and her 28-year-old daughter walked beneath the crane and the blue scaffolding surrounding the building about noon.
9_26	0.1258159	"We just walked by and said, 'If it falls, would it take her building out?"' said Catanio, whose daughter, Justine, works in a building across from the crane.
9_27	0.089315395	They decided she would be safe.
9_28	0.096206367	Stan Hochman, 83, who walked by the crane with his wife, said it made him nervous.
9_29	0.092886976	"I don't know what can be done about it," he said.
9_30	0.099099075	"You could walk across the street," his wife, Lee, 79, said.
9_31	0.10729684	"I think a crane like that could still reach you across the street," he responded.
9_32	0.093855212	Some New Yorkers showed no fear of cranes.
9_33	0.13984534	Shandley, who lives in the penthouse, said crane anxiety after Saturday's collapse was "an irrational fear."
9_34	0.10416328	Shandley, who works for a financial research company, added, "I don't think you should be any more worried about a crane than crossing the street and getting hit by a cab."
9_35	0.11601347	At West 24th Street and 10th Avenue, a crane stretching several stories into the air has been erecting what will be a residential building at 245 10th Ave.
9_36	0.093776019	The unfinished, L-shaped building wraps around a corner four-pump gas station.
9_37	0.12320049	Neighborhood residents said the boom of the crane often swings over the gas station to pick up materials on 24th Street.
9_38	0.119494	Goncalves, 33, used to live across the street from another crane in the East Village in 2006.
9_39	0.12947139	One day that September, a four-ton chunk of steel rigging from the crane fell 20 stories to the ground, crashing onto a cab, injuring five people and forcing evacuations.
9_40	0.11014669	Now she lives in a five-story building across from the crane at 245 10th Ave., and Saturday's collapse and her memories of the one in 2006 have made her uneasy.
9_41	0.11286848	"It crosses my mind every day," said Goncalves of the stability of the crane.
9_42	0.097897239	"It's scary."
9_43	0.098459264	Chrislorme Paul's memories of the 2006 collapse are more vivid -- and frightening.
9_44	0.090610082	He was driving that fateful cab.
9_45	0.096806102	The destroyed yellow cab sits in his brother's garage in Brooklyn, and sometimes people come to look at it.
9_46	0.097298619	Paul, 52, a native of Haiti who lives in Carnarsie, Brooklyn, with his wife and two children, still drives a cab, and he says a prayer when he drives by the East Village building now.
9_47	0.098385076	"It was a long day for me yesterday," said Paul, referring to Saturday.

9_50	0.097297022	On July 21, 1982, Warren F. Levenburg, controller of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, was walking near 53rd Street and Madison Avenue when -- without warning -- debris rained down.
9_51	0.11175286	A crane collapse on top of an office building sent pieces of granite, steel and glass falling 44 stories.
9_52	0.10239601	Levenburg was killed, and 16 others were injured.
9_53	0.089393183	He was 31 years old.
9_54	0.098785555	"He was a young man in the prime of his life walking down Madison Avenue," said Levenburg's wife, Susan Warrell, who now uses her maiden name and lives in Austin, Texas "I get a chill every time I see a crane."
