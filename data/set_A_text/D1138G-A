0_1	0.048212275	Connor Geddes was 13 days old when surgeons gave him a new heart that did not match his blood type -- deliberately.
0_2	0.039587303	Connor, now 11 months old and thriving, is one of several dozen babies around the world to have received mismatched hearts, part of a slowly growing movement to increase these tiniest patients' survival by taking advantage of a lag in their immune systems.
0_3	0.036966412	Now the U.S. transplant network is expanding that effort, saying youngsters may be candidates for an incompatible heart up to age 2.
0_4	0.12330223	It is the first step in a new push by the United Network for Organ Sharing to decrease the number of children who die awaiting an organ transplant, a toll particularly high for infants and toddlers.
0_5	0.035993023	"It will not happen overnight," cautioned Dr. Stuart Sweet of Washington University in St. Louis, chairman of UNOS' pediatric transplant committee.
0_6	0.06147402	But the new heart guidelines "have the potential for significantly impacting the number of patients who die on the waiting list."
0_7	0.0192201	If the policy sounds counterintuitive, well, it is: Implant a mismatched heart in an adult, and he or she will die rapidly.
0_8	0.020446373	That happened in 2003, when surgeons in North Carolina accidentally gave a teenager the wrong-type heart and lungs.
0_9	0.04318487	But babies' immune systems must learn to recognize and attack an organ of a different blood type, a process that is turning out to be more gradual than scientists long thought.
0_10	0.066432531	Transplant a heart before the baby starts making antibodies that will attack a mismatched organ, and he or she survives as well as babies given matching hearts, says Dr. Lori West, the Canadian surgeon who pioneered incompatible transplants in Toronto in the late 1990s.
0_11	0.057036158	Those babies still need immune-suppressing drugs for life -- blood type is just one form of organ rejection.
0_12	0.038698224	But given the scarcity of tiny hearts, the mismatch option was good news.
0_13	0.050125492	In 2005, the last count available, 45 children under age 2 died while awaiting a new heart.
0_14	0.04929818	As of last month, 74 youngsters under 2 were on the waiting list.
0_15	0.067128519	About one in 5,000 children are born with a heart defect so bad that they'll need a transplant in the first year or two of life.
0_16	0.080013819	Yet few babies die of conditions that allow their hearts to be donated.
0_17	0.063121325	Still, until recently, U.S. transplant centers were reluctant to try mismatched hearts.
0_18	0.060416836	UNOS began allowing them as a last resort for infants, under age 1, in 2002; only 19 were performed through 2005.
0_19	0.059098556	The concern: whether children really fare well years after getting a mismatched heart, or if rejection just sets in later.
0_20	0.072850229	But in the last year -- with some of West's initial patients now surviving a decade -- that worry is fading.
0_21	0.075022123	Now the question is who is a good candidate for a mismatched heart, says Dr. Steve Webber, cardiology chief at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
0_22	0.071038136	"We know we can't do it in adults, but what's the cutoff?" asks Webber.
0_23	0.08886582	"Nobody knows for sure."
0_24	0.082702085	Babies begin producing antibodies to different blood types between 5 months and 2 1/2 years of age -- it varies widely from child to child, says West, now at the University of Alberta's Stollery Children's Hospital.
0_25	0.086212007	Only a few of the 90 or so mismatched heart transplants performed worldwide have occurred past a child's first birthday, the oldest in a 30-month-old in Britain.
0_26	0.089351003	Still, age is just a rough marker for antibody production, West stresses.
0_27	0.091347814	Blood tests to check antibodies are the real key.
0_28	0.091091046	Hence the new U.S. policy, adopted last fall and to go into effect later this year.
0_29	0.091345722	It expands use of mismatched hearts up to age 2, as long as antibody tests show the toddlers are candidates.
0_30	0.094729006	For now, many transplant centers are like Webber's, trying their first mismatched transplants in babies before working up to toddlers.
0_31	0.095455767	Last March, Connor Geddes became Pittsburgh's first of five such transplants.
0_32	0.091281168	His heart's left side was too small to pump.
0_33	0.095945681	Doctors said Connor would not live long enough to await a heart that matched his Type A blood, but they had a heart from a Type B donor available.
0_34	0.093509473	"It still amazes me," says Carrie Geddes.
0_35	0.098574821	"When we talk to people, friends, and tell them, nobody really realizes that can happen."
0_36	0.099033835	Eleven months later, Connor shows no sign of rejection and happily totters after his older brothers.
0_37	0.096832821	His tracheotomy tube -- from lungs were weakened by heart-pumping machines while he awaited the transplant -- is to be removed soon, and the scar on his chest is barely visible.
0_38	0.097828344	UNOS' Sweet calls the heart policy "a first step in what we really think is a long process in improving wait-list mortality for all children."
0_39	0.095827191	At a first-of-its-kind meeting March, UNOS will take a hard look at hurdles to improving child organ donation, especially for babies and toddlers.
0_40	0.09710338	One problem is that when grieving parents consent to a donation, organs aren't always recovered, perhaps because the local transplant center did not immediately see a good recipient, Sweet says.
0_41	0.09773848	"It doesn't mean there is no patient suitable for that organ in the whole United States," he says.
0_42	0.097786623	"There are organs out there that if we find the right recipient, they could be transplanted.
0_43	0.099497432	Even if it's one at a time, I'm willing to work on that."

1_2	0.099583276	Lawmakers are considering legislation that would let prisoners donate organs or bone marrow in exchange for time off their jail sentences.
1_3	0.064209928	A state Senate panel on Thursday endorsed creating an organ-and- tissue donation program for inmates.
1_4	0.040238024	But legislators postponed debate on a measure to reduce the sentences of participating prisoners, citing concern that federal law may not allow it.
1_5	0.022100276	"I think it's imperative that we go all out and see what we can do," said the bills' chief sponsor, Democratic Sen. Ralph Anderson.
1_6	0.050642109	"I would like to see us get enough donors that people are no longer dying."
1_7	0.047580055	The proposal approved by the Senate Corrections and Penology Subcommittee would set up a volunteer donor program in prisons to teach inmates about the need for donors.
1_8	0.051748091	But lawmakers want legal advice before acting on a bill that would shave up to 180 days off a prison sentence for inmates who donate.
1_9	0.13247935	South Carolina advocates for organ donations said the incentive policy would be the first of its kind in the nation.
1_10	0.086590769	Federal law makes it illegal to give organ donors "valuable consideration."
1_11	0.061269666	Lawmakers want to know whether the term could apply to time off from prison sentences.
1_12	0.068856616	"We want to make this work, we really do," said Republican Sen. John Hawkins.
1_13	0.069848905	"But I want to make sure no one goes to jail for good intentions."
1_14	0.079807758	Mary Jo Cagle, chief medical officer of Bon Secours St. Francis Health System in Greenville, South Carolina, urged senators to find an allowable incentive.
1_15	0.090530614	"We have a huge need for organs and bone marrow," Cagle said.
1_16	0.09584301	But Melissa Blevins, executive director of Donate Life South Carolina, said any incentive would break the law and the principle behind donations.
1_17	0.096657594	"It really muddies the water about motive.
1_18	0.093559459	We want to keep it a clearly altruistic act," she said.
1_19	0.095422434	Under the proposals, money for medical procedures and any prison guard overtime would be paid by the organ recipient and charitable groups.
1_20	0.092131584	The state would also decide which inmates could donate.
1_21	0.097848916	Corrections Department Director Jon Ozmint said he believes inmates would donate even without the incentive.

2_0	0.076686391	Police are investigating whether a Kaiser Permanente transplant surgeon attempted to hasten the death last February of a 25-year- old San Luis Obispo, Calif., man on life support in order to harvest his organs more quickly.
2_1	0.18455074	The allegations, if true, would constitute a grave breach of the nation's organ transplant rules, as well as a public relations setback for those promoting organ donation, experts in transplantation said.
2_2	0.10925045	San Luis Obispo police and the Medical Board of California are looking into the conduct of Dr. Hootan Roozrokh, who was a surgeon at Kaiser's now-defunct kidney transplant program in San Francisco.
2_3	0.031245401	At issue is whether Roozrokh ordered excessive doses of powerful pain medication to speed up the death of Ruben Navarro, according to several sources familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because investigations are ongoing.
2_4	0.021880236	Roozrokh did not return messages left at his work and cell phones.
2_5	0.033360932	Medical board spokeswoman Candis Cohen said her agency also is investigating the conduct of a second physician present during the incident.
2_6	0.072193677	Sources identified the other doctor as Dr. Arturo Martinez, who at the time was the surgical director of Kaiser's transplant program, sources said.
2_7	0.076962329	Martinez could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.
2_8	0.11410705	Neither surgeon was recovering the organs on behalf of Kaiser; rather, they were working on behalf of the local group that procures and distributes organs in the region.
2_9	0.092406511	Dr. Timothy Pruett, president-elect of United Network for Organ Sharing, called the allegations ``horrific."
2_10	0.11771888	He worried that they could scare people away from donating organs to help the 95,000 people awaiting life-saving transplants nationwide.
2_11	0.117777	United Network for Organ Sharing is the federal contractor charged with ensuring the safety and equity of the nation's transplant system.
2_12	0.08545398	``We have to guarantee to the public that we're not going to go out and kill people to get their organs," said Pruett, chief of transplant surgery at the University of Virginia.

2_14	0.071508527	According to San Luis Obispo police, Navarro was on life support and near death after he was found unresponsive at Casa de Vida nursing home.
2_15	0.076543942	He was taken to Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo and placed on life support.
2_16	0.091156484	When it became clear he would not live, his family agreed to allow his organs to be harvested, and transplant surgeons were summoned on Feb. 3, 2006.
2_17	0.11612584	State law specifies that transplant physicians or surgeons are not allowed to be involved in the treatment of potential organ donors before they are declared dead.
2_18	0.092788878	This restriction is designed, in large part, to assuage concerns that the retrieval of organs could take priority over patient care.
2_19	0.090499623	In this case, however, Roozrokh entered the operating room at Sierra Vista and was directing the administration of drugs to Navarro and the removal of life support, the two sources said.
2_20	0.092458395	``Let's just give him some more candy," Roozrokh told nurses in the operating room, according to a person who was briefed on what took place.
2_21	0.096129606	When Navarro did not die within 30 minutes -- the time period set out to ensure the viability of the organs -- he was returned to the intensive care unit, according to standard transplant procedures.
2_22	0.095239141	He died the following morning and, by that time, his organs were no longer viable for transplantation, police said in a statement.
2_23	0.095087841	Within days, nurses at the hospital -- alarmed about what had taken place -- alerted their superiors, Sierra Vista spokesman Ron Yukelson said.
2_24	0.096963627	An investigation immediately was launched, and regulators and the coroner were notified.
2_25	0.098368751	Yukelson said outside transplant surgeons are not credentialed to operate on patients at the 165-bed hospital, and must wait until a patient isdeclared dead by hospital staff to begin organ procurement.

3_0	0.086414741	China's military is reportedly harvesting organs from prison inmates, mostly Falungong practitioners, for large scale transplants including for foreign recipients, a study said Wednesday.
3_1	0.074395132	Canada's former Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific region David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas released a report Wednesday into such transplants after interviewing organ recipients in 30 countries.
3_2	0.11326781	They also interviewed Canadian hospital staff who subsequently cared for hundreds of patients after they underwent dubious transplant surgeries in China.
3_3	0.064631529	"The involvement of the People's Liberation Army in these transplants is widespread," Kilgour told a press conference.
3_4	0.096968745	Like many civilian hospitals in rural China, military hospitals turned to selling organs to make up for government funding cuts in the 1980s, the report states.
3_5	0.022171539	But military personnel could operate with much more secrecy, it added.
3_6	0.073723619	"Recipients often tell us that even when they receive transplants at civilian hospitals, those conducting the operation are military personnel," the report states.
3_7	0.084196285	It is the second report to be released by the pair, who in July published the results of a two-month investigation in which they implicated dozens of hospitals and jails throughout China in the transplant scandal.
3_8	0.083824838	Those allegations were vigorously denied by Chinese officials.
3_9	0.081076042	Hospitals in Canada's biggest cities, Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto meanwhile confirmed "a substantial number" of Canadians had traveled to China for suspicious organ transplants, Kilgour said.
3_10	0.066750013	"We're in the three digits, up over 100 (from Canada each year) and the trend is accelerating," Matas said.
3_11	0.071445854	To curb what they called a "disgusting form of evil," the pair publicly asked pharmaceutical firms to stop selling organ anti- rejection drugs to China.
3_12	0.083882608	They also urged countries to post travel advisories warning that organs from China may have been harvested from unwilling donors; asked states to cease offering follow-up care to patients who had shady organ transplants in China; and called on foreign doctors to cut ties with their Chinese counterparts suspected of such practices.
3_13	0.088734032	States should also enact legislation to ban their citizens from traveling to China for organ transplants from forced donors, although the study's authors admitted such prosecutions would be difficult to prove.
3_14	0.086860788	The US-based lobby group "The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falungong in China" had asked Kilgour and Matas to investigate claims by several of their members.
3_15	0.091028598	China banned the spiritual group in 1999 and has vehemently denied the allegations of organ harvesting, accusing the Falungong of spreading rumors in a bid to undermine the country's international relations and "social stability."
3_16	0.093336915	Kilgour and Matas admitted that many of the claims were second- hand, but said there was enough evidence to "paint a picture."
3_17	0.099665105	They described one man traveling to Shanghai in 2003 for a kidney transplant at the civilian No. 1 People's Hospital and his convalescence at No. 85 hospital of the People's Liberation Army.

3_20	0.097944712	Wang Xiaohua, a Falungong practitioner who now lives in Montreal, told reporters he "suffered inhumane persecution" at a Chinese labor camp where jailed Falungong practitioners, and not other prisoners, were systematically subjected to blood tests to match their organs with recipients.
3_21	0.097820264	In their previous report, Matas and Kilgour interviewed several Falungong members and the former wife of a surgeon who told her he had removed the corneas from some 2,000 anaesthetized Falungong prisoners in northeast China in the two years prior to October 2003.
3_22	0.097765402	They said they listened, with the help of certified interpreters, to more than 30 veiled calls made from Canada and the United States to Chinese officials who admitted to the surgeries.

6_1	0.16415362	China needs a law on organ transplant to regulate donation procedures, and encourage and facilitate people to become donors, lawmakers said on the sidelines of the annual full session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
6_2	0.053960931	NPC deputy Li Bangliang, board chairman of East China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, said a proper law is needed to guide the public how to donate their organs if they have such an intention.
6_3	0.087581627	"With a large number of organs in need, some people want to donate but often run into difficulties in the application process, " said Li, adding a specific law should be enacted to standardize the application and transplant process."
6_4	0.1017477	China is faced with a huge gap between the patients who need functional organs and limited donations.
6_5	0.11057181	About 1.5 million patients need organ transplant each year, but only 10,000 can find organs for transplant, according to statistics from the Ministry of Health.
6_6	0.098130936	Most organs were donated by ordinary citizens upon their death after the voluntary signing of donation agreements.
6_7	0.10106658	It is strictly prohibited in China for illegal organ transplant, said Huang Jiefu, China's vice health minister.
6_8	0.1044292	Experts believe that the concept of dead-brain declaration will greatly promote organ transplant.
6_9	0.09339027	However, Chinese people's traditional view of "living till the last breath" has restrained living human organ supply, said NPC deputy Chen Haixiao, head of Taizhou Hospital in China's eastern Zhejiang Province.
6_10	0.0962804	"Social customs are a big reason," said Chen, explaining that many Chinese are unwilling to donate organs because they consider the stop of breath and heartbeat the standard of death.
6_11	0.096475906	He suggested the law allow doctors to declare people brain dead so their organs can be used to save the lives of people suffering the prostration of an organ.
6_12	0.096176885	"It will benefit many patients if the public can take the donation as a charity," said Chen.
6_13	0.097955987	Actually, the Ministry of Health in 2006 drafted a set of regulations on human organ transplant to the State Council for revision and improvement.
7_0	0.13509067	The University of California, San Francisco has taken over a post-transplant clinic for kidney patients at Kaiser Permanente's San Francisco hospital, bringing to an end Kaiser's brief -- and scandal-plagued -- foray into the organ transplant business.
7_1	0.092984448	The takeover means that UC doctors now will care for Kaiser's kidney transplant patients before, during and after their surgeries.
7_2	0.10753505	Kaiser had been caring for about 1,500 patients who had already received transplants.
7_3	0.10679621	``This is the last piece of the puzzle," said Dr. Stephen Tomlanovich, medical director of UC San Francisco's renal transplant program.
7_4	0.073116603	``It's been a long journey."
7_5	0.058099351	The giant HMO announced in May that it was closing its fledgling kidney transplant program after the Los Angeles Times reported that hundreds of patients had been endangered during its start-up in late 2004.
7_6	0.058415398	Kaiser had forced patients to leave established programs at two outside hospitals and join its own waiting list.
7_7	0.083606041	In the process, Kaiser lost track of many patients and delayed critical surgeries.
7_8	0.093150255	Since May, nearly 2,000 Kaiser patients awaiting transplants have been transferred to kidney programs at UC hospitals in San Francisco and Davis.
7_9	0.08113778	Fewer than 40 remain to be shifted.
7_10	0.07564292	Tomlanovich's team will take over from Kaiser's transplant medical director, Dr. Sharon Inokuchi.
7_11	0.0711367	Inokuchi, who has been faulted by federal regulators for her role in Kaiser's troubles, will become a non-transplant nephrologist with Kaiser's affiliated Permanente medical group once the last patient is transferred and the program officially closes.
7_12	0.095516717	Dr. Phil Madvig, associate executive director of the Permanente group, said the closure of the transplant program and the subsequent transfer of patients are a ``very significant undertaking" that the HMO is pleased to have nearly completed.
7_13	0.07211222	``That is a good feeling... that we have accomplished this and put this behind us," Madvig said.
7_14	0.08726859	In the nine months since the program announced its closure and began transferring patients, the pace of transplants has picked up considerably.
7_15	0.097530056	Nearly 120 Kaiser patients have received new kidneys, more than in the prior 20 months.
7_16	0.092714894	Some patients received transplants within weeks of transferring.
7_17	0.093839615	But the fallout from Kaiser's missteps continues.
7_18	0.094653341	Last month, the president of Kaiser's Northern California region, Mary Ann Thode, said she would retire by early 2008.
7_19	0.094656706	She was the HMO's public face after the scandal broke and alternately apologized and defended the program's quality.
7_20	0.096609801	In addition, Kaiser settled a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by former kidney transplant administrator David Merlin, who was fired in early 2006 after eight weeks on the job.
7_21	0.097453737	Merlin contended that Kaiser retaliated against him for raising concerns about the way the kidney program was operating.
7_22	0.097668366	In June, the administrator of Kaiser's San Francisco hospital, Mike Alexander, stepped down.
7_23	0.09796321	Two months later, Kaiser agreed to pay a $2-million fine to state HMO regulators and make a $3-million donation for organ donor outreach.
7_24	0.098186585	And in December, the national regulatory group overseeing transplantation stripped Kaiser of its good standing despite pleas from the HMO's representatives not to do so.
7_25	0.097850875	The state Department of Managed Health Care continues to investigate Kaiser for the way it handled patient complaints, including those from kidney patients who said they were ignored.
7_26	0.089104118	The results of that inquiry are expected next month.
8_0	0.14169363	The Philippine government is to begin consulting on guidelines for human organ donations to foreigners, a government official said Tuesday.
8_1	0.16900744	At present there are no specific rules on organ donation to foreigners.
8_2	0.1256365	Much of the trade in human organs, especially kidneys, takes place on the black market.
8_3	0.10290965	Health Undersecretary Jade Del Mundo said organ donation was big business in the Philippines, especially among the poor, who sell their kidneys.
8_4	0.078447566	A study conducted recently by the University of the Philippines found that in one slum area in Manila, there were 3,000 men and women who had sold one of their kidneys for 70,000-120,000 pesos (1,440-2,469 dollars).
8_5	0.095993639	Starting this weekend, the government will begin a series of consultations with private and public health sector leaders on how to regulate organ donation in the "face of rampant, under- the-table traffic in human organs," Del Mundo said.
8_6	0.096093084	He said the government was looking at ways of regulating the process by which kidneys were obtained.
8_7	0.099233144	A report in a Japanese newspaper recently said that if the system of organ donation were regulated, the Philippines could see a rush of foreign patients, including from Japan, where 10,000 people are currently awaiting kidney transplants.

9_1	0.1068384	Zimbabwe could soon revive its human organ donation program in a bid to keep up with global health technological developments, the official New Ziana reported on Saturday.
9_2	0.053650653	Health and Child Welfare Deputy Minister Edwin Muguti said strong regulatory measures would be put in place to ensure the success of the program and shield it from abuse.
9_3	0.065526961	Funding, which hindered the previous attempt to set up the program some 10 years ago, would also be sourced, he said.
9_4	0.094214032	The government is working on resuscitating the human organ donation program and, because of its international scrutiny, Zimbabwe will craft strong legislative laws to guard it from abuse, Muguti said.
9_5	0.094810589	He said the program, which registered some meaningful success in the early 1990s, would help address some health issues and improve service delivery.
9_6	0.097383695	Currently, patients that require human organ donations have to go abroad as Zimbabwe does not have adequate and proper resources such as machines and funds to conduct the operations.
