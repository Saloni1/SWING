0_0	0.17762202	Chronic sleep deprivation can do more than leave you short- tempered: it can also stress your heart and raise your risk of cardiovascular disease and death, according to a study released Wednesday.
0_1	0.044080222	The neurological and behavioural effects of long-term sleep loss have been well- documented, ranging from lowered concentration and hand-eye coordination to poor mood.
0_2	0.12421433	But the study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine adds to a growing body of evidence that there is also a physiological price to be paid for insufficient time under the sheets.
0_3	0.14852007	The study found that a sleep deficit built up over just five nights can significantly impair heart function.
0_4	0.11294588	The researchers tested the cardiac function of their 39 volunteers twice -- once at the beginning of the study, after a night of 10 hours' sleep, and again after five nights when they got a mere five hours of shut-eye each night.
0_5	0.10209044	The electrocardiograms revealed that all of the volunteers had a much faster heart beat and significantly less heart rate variability following the nights of sleep deprivation.
0_6	0.077574435	Heart rate variability describes the naturally occurring beat-to- beat changes in heart rate which reflect the body's adjustment to a host of stresses and stimuli.
0_7	0.088707278	Reduced variability can be a marker for cardiac problems and other diseases and has been linked to high blood pressure.
0_8	0.11124811	"The effect of the sleep deficit was to increase the stress on the hearts of these volunteers," said Siobhan Banks, a lead author on the study.
0_9	0.095758229	"If our finding is sustained by a larger group and further analysis, it may suggest why short sleep duration is associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality."
0_10	0.09787693	The findings are consistent with previous research showing that shift workers are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease due to the fact that they get less sleep because of the disruption in their circadian or sleep-wake rhythms.

1_1	0.19241606	Sleep loss or disturbed sleep can heighten the risk for adolescents to take up smoking and drinking, according to a new study.
1_2	0.10061312	The study, conducted by Xianchen Liu, MD, PhD, of the University of Pittsburgh, was based a questionnaire survey among 1, 362 adolescents, with an average age of 14.6 years, in five high schools in China.
1_3	0.098153934	The self-administered questionnaire collected data on sleep patterns, sleep problems, smoking and drinking behavior, behavioral and emotional problems, life stress, and demographic characteristics of the adolescent and family.
1_4	0.10860662	The research abstract was presented on Tuesday at SLEEP 2007, the 21st Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies (APSS) in Westchester, Illinois.
1_5	0.10450366	The results showed that sleeping less than eight hours at night, frequent nightmares and difficulty initiating sleep were significantly associated with drinking.
1_6	0.098425641	Further, smoking was related to sleeping less than eight hours, bedtime later than midnight, nightmares, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep and hypnotic medication use.
1_7	0.092415833	"These findings demonstrate significant associations between sleep quantity and sleep disturbances and smoking and drinking in Chinese adolescents," said Liu.
1_8	0.1031564	"Although prospective, longitudinal studies are warranted, these findings suggest a potential role of sleep intervention, that is, education in sleep hygiene and the treatment of sleep disturbances in the prevention of adolescent substance use."
1_9	0.10967416	The amount of sleep a person gets affects his or her physical health, emotional well-being, mental abilities, productivity and performance, according to the study.
1_10	0.10478896	Recent studies associate lack of sleep with serious health problems such as an increased risk of depression, obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
2_0	0.12085254	Sleep is critical to preparing the brain to lay down memories the next day, according to a Harvard study.
2_1	0.13024217	A single night of sleep deprivation can limit the consolidation of memory the next day, researchers showed in their study of 28 subjects, half of whom were kept awake all night.
2_2	0.046039662	The sleep-deprived subjects performed significantly worse on memory tests than those who had slept well, and their brain scans showed less activity in the area of the hippocampus that is key to remembering an event or episode.
2_3	0.22010333	There are two possible explanations for these results, according to the study.
2_4	0.077328431	Either the sleep-deprived body actively inhibits brain function, or the lack of sleep leads to an accumulation of information that overwhelms the hippocampus.
2_5	0.086550371	Other than humans, "few species are intentionally sleep-deprived," said lead author Seung-Schik Yoo of Brigham and Women's Hospital, so not much is known about the biological implications of sleep deprivation.
2_6	0.089466834	BOTTOM LINE: Even one night of lost sleep can impair the brain's ability to remember new information.
2_7	0.13738426	CAUTIONS: There are natural variations in the amount of sleep each person needs, and there is no universal definition of sleep deprivation.
2_8	0.093672135	WHAT'S NEXT: "What we did was just a snapshot of what actually happened" when people were deprived of sleep, but the "Holy Grail" of all sleep researchers, Yoo said, is to figure out what's really going on during sleep.

3_0	0.1546731	People tend to think of sleep problems as adult problems, connected to trouble with weight, diet, stress or depression.
3_1	0.10758451	But more and more children are having trouble sleeping -- and more often than not, a new study finds, treatment comes in the form of a pill.
3_2	0.15896132	The trend is concerning, the study authors say, because sleep deprivation can lead to headaches, irritability, impaired concentration and even behavior akin to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
3_3	0.073669663	In addition, little is known about the consequences of the prescriptions children are being given to deal with their sleep disturbances.
3_4	0.083041782	Neither their safety nor effectiveness has been studied in young people.
3_5	0.16748591	In the report, published in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal Sleep, researchers at Ohio State University in Columbus analyzed 18.6 million cases of sleep disorders in patients age 17 or younger.
3_6	0.099522877	They found that 81 percent of the cases resulted in a drug prescription to treat the problem.
3_7	0.046545297	Only 7 percent of patients received dietary counseling, and only 22 percent were given behavioral therapies such as psychotherapy or stress- management counseling.
3_8	0.054037942	The data, collected from 1993 to 2004 as part of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, consisted of nationwide records of visits to doctors within all areas of medical practice.
3_9	0.06479189	The high rates of sleep-disorder prescriptions are supported by industry figures.
3_10	0.062393544	According to a drug trend report published by Medco, a company that processes prescription-drug claims, sedative or hypnotic drug prescriptions grew at a rate of 14.6 percent in 2006, faster than any other class of medications.
3_11	0.070309295	Medco also reported large increases in sleep-aid prescriptions made to children ages 10 to 19, an 80 percent increase for girls and a 64 percent increase for boys from 2001 to 2006.
3_12	0.064168285	Often, the drugs were not ones specifically designed to aid sleep.
3_13	0.069656754	Antihistamines (such as Atarax) and alpha-2-agonist drugs (such as Catapres or Tenex) have sedative effects secondary to their intended use.
3_14	0.079558582	Drugs such as non-benzodiazepines, specifically designed to aid sleep, were given less often.
3_15	0.099185582	Many factors that impair sleep in adults such as obesity are at work in kids, says study senior author Milap Nahata, an Ohio State University professor of medicine.
3_16	0.092349521	Changed habits may be playing a part as well.
3_17	0.092590677	The National Sleep Foundation reported in 2006 that only 20 percent of adolescents get the recommended nine hours of sleep; distractions such as computers or video games in kids' bedrooms may lessen sleep quality.
3_18	0.091737004	Sleep issues in children aren't always easy to recognize.
3_19	0.11334355	``Children with sleep disorders don't necessarily look sleepy," says Dr. Ronald Chervin, director of the University of Michigan Sleep Disorder Center.
3_20	0.093683646	``Some (sleepy) children look hyperactive -- they fidget, they jump up and down."
3_21	0.096411655	He says it's reasonable for doctors to prescribe a sleep aid for a short time while behavioral changes, which can be quite effective, are made.
3_22	0.10432076	Only 19 percent of cases in the study received medication in concert with behavior therapy.
3_23	0.098339902	Chervin adds that in some cases, such as when a child is developmentally impaired, behavioral approaches may not be appropriate.
3_24	0.09967365	In other cases, pediatricians may be too busy to try behavioral approaches, or they may be influenced by parents.
3_25	0.10223606	Many doctors lack understanding of sleep disorders, says Dr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute.
3_26	0.09763064	Medical schools spend only a few hours on the topic.

4_1	0.1196615	The study, conducted by researchers from several universities and hospitals in the western Japanese city of Kyoto, revealed a link between wake-up times and a person's cardiovascular condition.
4_2	0.072363588	"Rising early to go to work or exercise might not be beneficial to health, but rather a risk for vascular diseases," said an abstract of the study.
4_3	0.081547466	The study, covering 3,017 healthy adults aged between 23 through 90, found that early risers had a greater risk of heart conditions including hypertension and of having strokes.
4_4	0.096849511	However, the study also noted that early risers were usually older.
4_5	0.11123624	The study is being presented this week at the World Congress of the World Federation of Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine Societies, being held in Cairns, Australia.
4_6	0.10788845	A separate study released in June by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that chronic sleep deprivation adds stress to the heart, putting a person at greater risk of cardiovascular disease and death.

5_1	0.1907772	Doctors rarely note the sleep problems of older patients, although two-thirds of them report these complaints, according to a new study.
5_2	0.12442208	Researchers at the U.S. Northwestern University studied 1,503 patients aged 60 and older who visited their primary-care doctors.
5_3	0.10716275	They surveyed the patients about sleep problems and found that 69 percent of the patients had at least one sleep complaint, and 40 percent had two or more.
5_4	0.072803493	Forty-five percent of the patients said they had "difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or being able to sleep."
5_5	0.11735352	The study, published in a recent issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, said despite the high rate of sleep complaints among the patients, a sleep complaint was only reported by the doctor in the patient's chart 19 percent of the time, even when the patient indicated sleep problems in all five sleep questions on the survey.
5_6	0.11761424	This is important, since previous research has linked sleep disorders in the elderly to poorer mental and physical health and quality of life, the study noted.
5_7	0.077905027	"A doctor may not think that it's very important to ask the patient about sleep.
5_8	0.093952843	We (the researchers) hypothesize that doctors think that sleep problems are a normal part of aging, and there's not much they can do about it," study author Kathryn Reid, a research assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine, said.
5_9	0.098928555	But while some sleep problems - including a reduction in deep sleep - tend to occur with age, sleep disturbances are not an inevitable part of aging.
5_10	0.10039337	In fact, a recent study found that among older people with exceptionally good health, only 1 percent had sleep difficulties.
5_11	0.095912005	"Now, a lot of studies show that not getting enough sleep can lower your metabolic function; be associated with cardiovascular problems, cancer and breast cancer in women; and increase our mortality.
5_12	0.10107749	Sleep deprivation also increases your sensitivity to pain," Reid said.

6_1	0.19444429	Is there a correlation between lack of sleep and weight gain?
6_2	0.079808417	Every two years for 16 years, the Nurses Health Study collected data from more than 68,000 women ages 40 to 65, which included information on sleep habits and body weight.
6_3	0.10102731	The study found that participants who slept five hours a night were 32 percent more likely to experience a weight gain of 33 pounds or greater, and 15 percent more likely to become obese, compared with participants who slept seven hours a night.
6_4	0.059010304	The group who slept for six hours were 12 percent more likely to experience major weight gain and 6 percent more likely to become obese when compared with those who slept seven hours a night.
6_5	0.091669069	One possible explanation for these differences is that lack of sleep causes the body to burn calories less efficiently.
6_6	0.040308075	Variations in eating habits and exercise among the groups also explained some of the weight gain, although no single factor can be pinpointed.
6_7	0.10711361	The amount and quality of sleep affects hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism.
6_8	0.11832694	A study at the University of Chicago found that participants who slept only four hours a night for two nights had an 18 percent decrease in leptin and a 28 percent increase in ghrelin.
6_9	0.033026547	Leptin is a hormone that suppresses appetite by affecting how full and satisfied we feel after eating.
6_10	0.083770321	Ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite.
6_11	0.13191724	With sleep deprivation, levels of leptin fall, while ghrelin levels increase.
6_12	0.076364752	Participants in the study, all healthy young men, showed a 24 percent increase in appetite along with elevated cravings for sweets, salty foods, and starchy foods like bread and pasta.
6_13	0.057908465	Leptin is only one of a large number of genes that can influence body weight, while environment and lifestyle behaviors remain the primary causes of weight gain.
6_14	0.068112702	When a person is fatigued from too little sleep, they are also less likely to exercise, making it easier to put on extra pounds.
6_15	0.089309758	Lack of sleep affects other hormones such as cortisol, insulin and growth hormone, potentially causing a desire for high-calorie foods.
6_16	0.092127557	It is believed that decreased amounts of REM sleep can lead to increased food intake.
6_17	0.086778141	REM stands for "Rapid Eye Movement" and is the "dream" phase of the sleep cycle.
6_18	0.095204184	During REM sleep brain activity increases with less muscle activity.
6_19	0.11193883	Aside from the potential increase in body weight, sleep deprivation can have serious effects on physical and mental health.
6_20	0.08875901	When the brain has to work harder in an effort to counteract sleep deficit, its ability to function deteriorates quickly.

6_22	0.093216033	The ability to handle everyday stress, maintain a healthy immune system and control emotions is also compromised.
6_23	0.09628735	It is recommended that children ages 3 to 5 years get 11-13 hours of sleep per night; ages 5-12, 9 to 11 hours; and adolescents, 8 1/2 to 9 1/2 hours.
6_24	0.097415694	Although most experts recommend seven to nine hours of sleep a night for adults, the exact amount needed to function at our best varies from person to person.

8_0	0.22494231	A new study by British researchers reveals that women's health is much more at risk from sleep deprivation than men's.
8_1	0.14410258	The study, carried out by researchers at Warwick Medical School at the University of Warwick, Britain, involved 5,766 volunteers (4,199 men and 1,567 women) from 20 London-based civil service departments, according to a press release from the university on Friday.
8_2	0.10851859	The researchers looked at men and women sleeping less than or equal to 5 hours a night to see if their risk of developing hypertension was any higher than men and women getting the recommended 7 hours or more of sleep a night.
8_3	0.10820073	The researchers found that those women in the study group who slept less than or equal to 5 hours a night were twice as likely to suffer from hypertension than women who slept for the recommended seven hours or more a night.
8_4	0.097173118	The researchers found no difference between men sleeping less than 5 hours and those sleeping 7 hours or more.
8_5	0.090305908	The researchers defined hypertension as blood pressure equal to or higher than 140/90 mm Hg or if the subject made regular use of antihypertensive medications.
8_6	0.12391524	Among other problems, increased hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, according to the researchers.
8_7	0.097366105	Sustained sleep curtailment, ensuing excessive daytime sleepiness, and the higher cardiovascular risk are causes for concern with emerging evidence suggesting a potential role for sleep deprivation as a predictor or risk factor for conditions such as obesity and diabetes, according to Professor Francesco Cappuccio, who led the research.
9_0	0.1055772	Getting a good night's sleep has its rewards, such as reduced fatigue and better concentration.
9_1	0.053345397	For athletes, the benefits may be even bigger -- faster speed and improved performance.
9_2	0.063517812	Those are the findings from a recent, albeit small study in which college basketball players fared better on sprints and free throws after sleeping more than they normally did.
9_3	0.10305578	``Athletes understand how important training is, and nutrition, but there's a third component that makes a big difference in how they perform -- sleep," says Cheri Mah, lead author of the study presented last week at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies' meeting in Minneapolis.
9_4	0.15524248	Mah, a researcher at the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic and Research Laboratory, says athletes often aren't counseled on the value of adequate sleep, adding that college students are no strangers to sleep deprivation, sometimes maxing out at five or six hours of sleep a night.
9_5	0.059404935	That's far below the 91/2 to 10 hours recommended by sleep experts for adolescents and young adults.
9_6	0.084229528	The study followed six Stanford basketball players, ages 18 to 21, during their 2006 playing season.
9_7	0.083612165	For two weeks they followed normal sleep patterns, then they were told to sleep as much as they could for six weeks, with a goal of 10 hours a night, and to maintain a regular sleeping and waking schedule.
9_8	0.062521847	During both phases, the players were tested several times a week on sprints and free throws after team practice.
9_9	0.093151811	Sprint times improved by a second by the end of the study (16.3 compared with 15.3 on a 282-foot sprint).
9_10	0.082983603	Free throws averaged 7.9 (out of 10) during the regular sleep period, versus 8.8 at the end.
9_11	0.086919304	Three-point shots picked up as well, averaging 9.2 (out of 15) during regular sleep and 11 upon completion.
9_12	0.097208981	Mah says that since the study began in the middle of the season, ``there shouldn't be a learning curve from the baseline" that would greatly affect the results.
9_13	0.093414951	The athletes were also given standard subjective written tests that measured mood and fatigue; after sleeping more, they reported increased energy and improved mood.
9_14	0.092875488	``I think the sleep debt is the biggest factor that's weighing down these athletes," Mah says.
9_15	0.097148962	``When they're in season, they believe they're doing well, but they don't realize how much better they'd be if they reduced their sleep debt.
9_16	0.08886497	A lot of athletes think that fatigue is normal."
9_17	0.098837251	A previous study on sleep deprivation published in 1999 in the Lancet found that less sleep resulted in impaired glucose metabolism, which affects how the body stores and processes glucose for energy.
9_18	0.097682715	Even for the weekend basketball player, more sleep could result in better games, says Mah: ``Getting a little extra sleep will give you that little bit more."
