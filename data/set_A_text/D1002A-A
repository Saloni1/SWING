1_0	0.20689655172413793	With the indictments barely unsealed against four police officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details.
1_1	0.0	Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole incident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often fuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a crucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges.
1_2	0.19047619047619047	Both sides hope to use forensic evidence to answer vexing questions that have loomed since Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in fusillade of 41 bullets fired into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
1_3	0.0	Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting?
1_4	0.0	How quickly did he fall?
1_5	0.0	Is there anything at the crime scene to explain why the officers unleashed such firepower at an unarmed man?
1_6	0.0	The potential significance of the forensic evidence is apparent in the efforts being expended by all sides to collect it:
1_7	0.0	The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has done an extensive re-enactment of the shooting at the department's firing range.
1_8	0.0	The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced bullet trajectories with lasers.
1_9	0.0	Defense lawyers have employed their own set of crime-scene specialists who may be called to rebut whatever theories the prosecution's experts propose.
1_10	0.1111111111111111	The Diallo family has employed a pathologist whose autopsy has led to charges by their lawyers that the West African immigrant was shot repeatedly, even after he had collapsed, paralyzed, from his initial wounds.
1_11	0.16666666666666666	``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil suit in the case.
1_12	0.0	``You can question their story based on common sense and logic and what passersby might have seen or heard.
1_13	0.0	But none of that can be as devastating an impeachment as objective, irrefutable scientific evidence.''
1_14	0.0	Not surprisingly, the officers' lawyers embrace the same irrefutable science to argue a opposite position.
1_15	0.2	``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four accused of second-degree murder.
1_16	0.0	``What the forensic evidence will not show is that these officers fired repeatedly into a prone body.
1_17	0.0	Quite the contrary, I expect it to show the opposite, that, namely, the vast majority of the shots, if not all of the shots, were fired at a standing person.''
1_18	0.0	Of course, it is far from certain that a verdict in the case will hinge on forensic evidence.
1_19	0.07692307692307693	Assuming the officers testify, their credibility in asserting that they feared for their lives in the mistaken belief that Diallo was armed could also be a decisive factor.
1_20	0.0	But it seems likely that a dizzying parade of expert witnesses will take the stand at the trial to debate the trigonometric calculation of bullet trajectories, and more importantly, to contradict one another.
1_21	0.0	``Ideally, the physical evidence should support one conclusion,'' said Peter R. De Forest, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
1_22	0.0	``But what often happens is that one side or the other pays someone to dispute it and the science gets polluted.''
1_23	0.36363636363636365	The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial.
1_24	0.07692307692307693	But the Diallo family lawyers have shown no such reticence, virtually constructing a criminal case against the officers while preparing the civil suit.
1_25	0.0	One of the central disputes will likely focus on the officers' assertion that Diallo continued to stand upright, even after he had been hit by many of the 19 bullets that struck him.
1_26	0.13333333333333333	There are apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account, although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting.
1_27	0.0	But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage.
1_28	0.23529411764705882	``Amadou Diallo was already on the ground with his spinal cord severed,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family adviser, ``so the alibi they have put on the court record will devastate the defense.''
1_29	0.09523809523809523	The official autopsy by the city Medical Examiner's office does not discuss the sequence of shots, the position of Diallo's body when he was hit or whether he was paralyzed at any point, people who have reviewed the report have said.
1_30	0.15384615384615385	The autopsy report does indicate that two shots, one from the front and one from the back, perforated Diallo's spine at separate points.
1_31	0.0	Those perforations are the primary basis for the family's conclusion that he was paralyzed.
1_32	0.0	Wecht's analysis that those shots came early in the sequence is based, in part, on the amount of blood from those wounds that filled his chest cavity.
1_33	0.05555555555555555	But Marvyn Kornberg, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said the officers' semiautomatic weapons fired so fast that it is impossible to determine with any precision when the shots to the chest were fired.
1_34	0.0	``You are talking about a matter of eight seconds,'' he said.
1_35	0.0	``You can't tell which is first and which is second.
1_36	0.0	Any medical examiner who testifies to that can expect some rigorous cross examination.''
1_37	0.15384615384615385	A second set of bullets that struck Diallo's right leg and foot also figure to be a source of debate.
1_38	0.0	The city's autopsy indicates that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report have said.
1_39	0.09090909090909091	The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe ``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen.
1_40	0.0	Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired subsequent rounds.
1_41	0.21052631578947367	There could also be a dispute over just how much time elapsed as the 41 shots were fired, especially since witnesses have said they heard a pause in the firing, apparently caused when Officer Edward McMellon fell down while firing.
2_0	0.8	The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.
2_1	0.0	They left the courtroom to the cheers of nearly 200 other officers, gathered outside the Bronx County Building.
2_2	0.0	But inside state Supreme Court, the defense team showed signs of division.
2_3	0.2	Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Sean Carroll, said he might make a motion to disqualify Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Edward McMellon.
2_4	0.0	Kornberg said Worth, who had represented all of the officers immediately after the shooting, might have a conflict of interest now since he was representing only one of them and might be forced to cross-examine the others.
2_5	0.0	It was a point that Worth disputed outside court by saying, ``I don't think I have a conflict of interest, though it is obvious that Kornberg would like for me to go.''
2_6	0.3333333333333333	Police officials declined to say where the officers _ Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy, Carroll and McMellon _ would be working, adding only that they were on modified duty and carrying no guns or badges.
2_7	0.0	Worth said that the officers reported to their new assignments Friday but would not officially start work until Monday, on what police officials called administrative assignments.
2_8	0.0	Friday, acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who refused defense requests to put off scheduling a date for the case, chose the Jan. 3 date after the defense lawyers said they would need time to go through the prosecution's evidence and discuss possible pretrial motions.
2_9	0.0	The lawyers also said there could be pretrial scheduling conflicts because of other trials some of them are involved in, like the Abner Louima case, in which officers are accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant.
2_10	0.0	That case is set to begin on Tuesday.
2_11	0.0	Prosecutors turned over more than 160 pages of forensic, ballistic and crime scene evidence to the defense lawyers, adding that more would be forthcoming.
2_12	0.0	The judge said the next court appearance would be on Sept. 29, when she would decide all motions.
2_13	0.35714285714285715	While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
2_14	0.0	Defense lawyers are usually pleased by delays to the extent that they can temper bad publicity about the case, which they see as possibly prejudicial to their clients.
2_15	0.0	But if the delay was welcome, there were still Kornberg's efforts to force Worth, the official lawyer for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, off the case.
2_16	0.0	Kornberg said later that if Worth was not disqualified, Kornberg might push for a separate trial for Carroll.
2_17	0.0	The issue of severing the cases is important because the defendants will probably need one another's testimony to corroborate their accounts of the shooting.
2_18	0.10526315789473684	For example, the defense has suggested that the 41 shots fired at Diallo _ a number that has become a flash point in the case _ were precipitated by one of the officers yelling ``Gun!'' and another falling down some steps as if he had been shot.
