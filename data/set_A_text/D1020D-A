0_0	0.06666666666666667	President Clinton plans to press Congress on Saturday to provide all $101 million he has sought to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply.
0_1	0.0	But Congress seems unlikely to cooperate.
0_2	0.14285714285714285	Clinton also plans to announce two steps the administration can take without congressional authority to protect food safety, administration officials said.
0_3	0.06818181818181818	According to an advance text of his Saturday radio address, the president will also ask Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration ``greater authority to halt imports of fruits, vegetables and other food products that are produced under safety conditions that do not match our own strict standards,'' and to give the Department of Agriculture ``new authority to impose tough fines on businesses who violate those standards and to issue mandatory recall of unsafe meat and poultry.''
0_4	0.0	The government has no reliable tracking system, but health officials say food-borne diseases account for up to 30 million cases of illness and 9,000 deaths a year.
0_5	0.17391304347826086	There have been many large outbreaks of food-borne illness in the last year, including one just last week that made a New York woman ill and resulted in the recall of 172,000 pounds of ground-beef patties contaminated with the deadly bacteria E. coli O157:H7.
0_6	0.034482758620689655	But Congress has failed to address legislation proposed by the administration to give the food agencies greater authority, and it appears unlikely that Congress will provide the full amount of money the administration has requested to expand inspections, increase research and surveillance of food-borne illness and educate consumers.
0_7	0.0	Before the July 4 recess, the House voted to provide only $16.8 million of the requested money, and the Senate bill, which has not been voted on, provides just $2.6 million.
0_8	0.0	``Until the day the agencies can quantitatively answer how much it would cost to reduce food-borne illness,'' said John Ziolkowski, a staff member of the House Appropriations Committee, ``they won't get any more money.
0_9	0.0	If they can say we will cut food-borne illness by so much, I'm sure the members would say that is a serious proposal.
0_10	0.0	Did we provide enough money?
0_11	0.0	No.
0_12	0.0	I'm sure we didn't for a lot of people.''
0_13	0.0	The chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture, Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said that even though some new programs proposed by the administration had merit, the committee did not have the money for them.
0_14	0.0	So it provided nothing.
0_15	0.16666666666666666	Instead, Cochran suggested that some of the Food and Drug Administration's duties be delegated to states and local governments.
0_16	0.0	But government officials say more action is needed.
0_17	0.0	``Food-borne diseases are a continuing problem that have not yet been resolved,'' said Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief of the food-borne and diarrheal diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
0_18	0.13333333333333333	This fact has been underscored in the last few months by two unexpected outbreaks of food-borne illnesses: travelers' diarrhea, or enterotoxigenic E. coli, from potato salad, which sickened 4,000 people in Illinois, and salmonella in breakfast cereal, which made 200 people ill in 11 states.
0_19	0.0	``Salmonella in breakfast cereal is basically a first for us in this country,'' Tauxe said.
0_20	0.0	``We cannot have a breakfast-cereal plant having failures like that, and that's an inspection problem.''
0_21	0.0	The potato salad outbreak is equally worrisome, he said.
0_22	0.0	``We used to believe you had to travel overseas to get travelers' diarrhea.
0_23	0.0	It's a classic example of emerging infections common in Latin America becoming a problem here.''
0_24	0.23076923076923078	Despite what Tauxe described as ``extraordinary efforts'' to prevent E. coli O157:H7 from contaminating meat, it continues to be a problem.
0_25	0.3	``I don't feel that recalls are the answer,'' he said, ``because we don't want E. coli in the meat to begin with.
0_26	0.0	That's a sign that additional efforts are needed.''
0_27	0.09090909090909091	Since 1988, the number of products recalled for life-threatening microbial contamination has increased almost fivefold, according to the FDA.
0_28	0.05555555555555555	In 1993, the agency asked the administration for the power to bar fruits, vegetables, grains, fish and other food from countries with food-safety systems inferior to that of the United States.
0_29	0.0	But advocates of free trade oppose ceding that power, called equivalency, and no action, executive or legislative, has been taken.
0_30	0.0	The Department of Agriculture has the power to bar imported meat and poultry, but in a report issued in May, the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said ``Federal agencies cannot ensure that the growing volume of imported food is safe for consumers,'' and recommended that the power of equivalency be extended to cover all foods eligible for import.

0_33	0.0	The FDA now deals with imported food only after it arrives.
0_34	0.0	It inspects slightly more than 1.5 percent of all foreign shipments, and among imported produce items, a source for some extremely serious outbreaks of food-borne illness, only 0.2 percent were sampled last year.
0_35	0.0	The number of shipments of food for which the FDA is responsible has increased to 2.2 million from 1.5 million five years ago.

0_39	0.0	And in his radio address, the president will announce what the administration can do without congressional approval.
0_40	0.07142857142857142	One measure is an FDA rule requiring warning labels on all packaged juice that has not been pasteurized or processed to kill harmful bacteria.
0_41	0.23076923076923078	A second measure is the creation of a national institute for food safety research to coordinate public and private research.
0_42	0.1875	Unpasteurized apple juice, contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, caused the death of a 16-month-old child last year and led to the hospitalization of a dozen other children.
0_43	0.0	The new labeling rule will take effect in time for the apple cider season.
0_44	0.07142857142857142	``Congress is sitting on its hands while we watch all these outbreaks occur around this country,'' said Caroline Smith deWaal, director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group based in Washington, ``and things are not going to get better without resources and authority to regulate food.''
1_0	0.18518518518518517	When the first reports of a food-poisoning outbreak from hot dogs and deli meats started to accumulate in state health departments across the United States last August, officials could not have guessed that the effort to contain the eruption would be so ineffective that they would still be counting victims five months later.
1_1	0.2	A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary, Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich., began on Dec. 22.
1_2	0.07692307692307693	But some state public health officials say the outbreak could have been contained sooner had the Agriculture Department done its job.
1_3	0.0625	To its credit, the Agriculture Department has announced recalls of processed meats contaminated with listeria from four other companies in the last four months, most recently last weekend.
1_4	0.0	But consumers may have a difficult time understanding why those recalls were announced by the government and Bil Mar's was not.
1_5	0.0	Listeria monocytogenes is not a serious threat to healthy people, causing only short-term gastrointestinal problems.
1_6	0.38461538461538464	But it is a big risk to people 75 and older, people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and the very young.
1_7	0.5	Pregnant women and their unborn children are in the greatest danger.
1_8	0.0	The current outbreak associated with Bil Mar has been blamed for 13 deaths and two miscarriages or stillbirths; in all, there have been 70 confirmed cases.
1_9	0.3333333333333333	Unlike salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7, which have become household words in the United States, listeria is not well known.
1_10	0.05555555555555555	There are only 1,000 to 2,000 reported cases of listeriosis in the United States each year; an accurate figure cannot be obtained, as health professionals do not routinely test for it and many cases go undetected.
1_11	0.0	But health officials find it especially troubling because, based on the number of reported cases, the percentage of people who die from it is much higher than from most other food-borne bacteria.
1_12	0.0	And the incubation period is much longer, up to 70 days before symptoms appear.
1_13	0.0	``Listeria is rare,'' said Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief of the food-borne and diarrheal diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, ``but in someone susceptible, it is catastrophic.''
1_14	0.18181818181818182	In addition to causing miscarriages and stillbirths, listeria can cause fatal blood infections and meningitis.
1_15	0.0	Without a new method of detection, Tauxe said, ``I don't think we would have identified where the listeria came from.''
1_16	0.0	The new system, called Pulsenet, gives scientists the ability to fingerprint the DNA of bacteria and then compare the fingerprints to see if the listeria is from a common source.
1_17	0.23076923076923078	The system was set up in 1997 to track E. coli 0157:H7, but it appears to be equally successful with listeria.
1_18	0.06666666666666667	American scientists began to take listeria seriously in 1985, when 18 deaths were traced to the eating of Jalisco brand soft cheese.
1_19	0.0	(The company is now defunct.)
1_20	0.0	There were also 30 stillbirths and deaths of newborns.
1_21	0.0	Another 142 people became ill.
1_22	0.05	Listeria is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come in contact with dairy products, uncooked meats, fish, poultry and vegetables as well as precooked meats like the ones responsible for the August outbreak.
1_23	0.09090909090909091	The investigators say they do not know how the listeria contaminated the cooked meats at Bil Mar Foods.
1_24	0.06666666666666667	Food-borne diseases like listeriosis are more troubling today for several reasons, including changes in the makeup of the population and the increasingly complex way food is processed and distributed.
1_25	0.0	The population is aging: In 1950, 2.6 percent of Americans were over 74; by 1995, the percentage was 5.6.
1_26	0.0	The number of people who survive cancer for five years has also increased, as has the number of people who have AIDS or are living with transplanted organs.
1_27	0.18181818181818182	In addition, the centralization of food production has turned what might previously have been a small local problem into a global one.
1_28	0.125	Products from the Bil Mar plant, for example, are distributed all over the United States.
1_29	0.22727272727272727	Still, Dr. Michael Osterholm, the state epidemiologist at the Minnesota Health Department, says he is increasingly frustrated with the federal government's response to outbreaks of food poisoning, and even with the new detection system.
1_30	0.09090909090909091	In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
1_31	0.0	The agency does not announce recalls until it has proof that a sealed product contains the disease-causing bacteria, and it did not have that proof until Dec. 31, nine days later.
1_32	0.045454545454545456	When the company announced the recall, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, Andrew Solomon, said, reporters who cover the agency were notified and the information was put on the agency's Web site and on its consumer-information line (800-535-4555).
1_33	0.0	``We felt the word was out there and an additional press release would not have generated new news coverage,'' he said.
1_34	0.0	Osterholm disagrees.
1_35	0.0	``If there had been a real effort to get the message out by the Department of Agriculture throughout the country, consumers would have had more awareness,'' he said.
1_36	0.0	Both he and Dale Morris, the director of the division of infectious disease of the New York State Health Department, say there can never be enough notification.
1_37	0.0	In Broome County, in upstate New York, they say, Meals on Wheels was still serving the Bil Mar products to elderly clients eight days after the recall, because it had not been notified.
1_38	0.0	``Those people are one of the highest-risk populations in the country,'' Osterholm said.
1_39	0.4444444444444444	And there may still be tainted hot dogs or deli meats in people's freezers.
1_40	0.14285714285714285	In other cases, the Agriculture Department did take action.
1_41	0.3076923076923077	Over the weekend, it announced the recall of hot dogs from Thorn Apple Valley in Forrest City, Ark., because of listeria.
1_42	0.28	The previous week, the agency announced the recall of deli meat from Oscar Mayer Foods for the same bacteria, as it did in October for hot dogs made by Dixie Packers Inc. of Madison, Fla., and cheeseburger sandwiches from Hormel Food Corp.
1_43	0.05555555555555555	As usual, the last line of defense against food-borne illness is consumers, who are advised to take the standard measures: thorough cooking of raw animal products, thorough washing of all food that is to be eaten raw like fruits and vegetables; keeping foods to be eaten raw separate from uncooked meats; thorough washing of hands, knives and cutting boards.
1_44	0.0	Unlike many other disease-causing bacteria, listeria can grow in a refrigerator that has a normal temperature of 40 degrees, which means leftovers should be reheated.
1_45	0.0	But how does this advice fit in with meats that people expect to eat without further cooking?
1_46	0.058823529411764705	Public health officials strongly urge those at greatest risk from listeria to stay away from all soft cheeses, including feta and blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort and Camembert.
1_47	0.23076923076923078	They also say that it is essential to cook hot dogs until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees, by either steaming or frying.
1_48	0.0	Cooking in the microwave is not recommended.
1_49	0.0	And unless people at risk are willing to eat salami, corned beef and pastrami hot _ in other words, cooked again _ they should not eat them at all.
1_50	0.0	``Listeria hasn't been on anyone's radar screen,'' Tauxe said.
1_51	0.6	``But it's something pregnant women should be made aware of.
1_52	0.3333333333333333	At this point, as far as I can tell, the number of pregnant women who are aware of this is zero.''

3_3	0.05555555555555555	Lee's once-rare disease has received tremendous attention in recent months, especially since a massive recall in December of possibly tainted food from a Michigan plant.
3_4	0.23076923076923078	Bil Mar Foods Co., a meat processor owned by Sara Lee in Zeeland, Mich., recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and cold cuts after a rare strain of the listeria bacteria was found in both opened and unopened packages.
3_5	0.21428571428571427	The same strain, pattern E, has been linked to 12 adult deaths and five miscarriages among 82 illnesses in 19 states.
3_6	0.08695652173913043	Aside from causing stillbirths and miscarriages, listeriosis also can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in people with weakened immune systems: infants, the elderly or patients with chronic diseases, HIV infection or undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
3_7	0.21428571428571427	Although Bil Mar is the only plant to have an outbreak with illnesses traced to its products, several others across the country have had to recall products after tests detected listeria.
3_8	0.4	Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs.

9_8	0.0	``The new information based on this outbreak brings into question the adequacy of control procedures we've been relying on,'' Billy said.
9_9	0.0	The focus is on ready-to-eat foods such as luncheon meats because the bacterium can be killed if it is cooked until steaming hot, or past about 170 degrees.
9_10	0.08333333333333333	Fewer than 2,000 people in the United States report serious illness from listeriosis each year, but about one in four of them die from it.
9_11	0.13333333333333333	Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22.
9_12	0.16666666666666666	That recall, and one in January of about 30 million pounds of hot dogs and luncheon meat from the Thorn Apple Valley plant in Arkansas, represent most of the increase in the pounds pulled from shelves for listeria contamination in recent years.
9_13	0.0	Since 1989, when the government implemented stricter policies for the bacterium, illnesses from listeria monocytogenes have dropped 44 percent.
9_14	0.0	At the meeting, some federal officials also questioned whether they acted quickly enough in the Bil Mar recall.
9_15	0.0	Officials at the Centers for Disease Control had managed to trace 20 cases of food sickness to the Bil Mar plant by Dec. 18, and USDA officials said they met Bil Mar executives to urge them to consider a recall then.
9_16	0.0	However, USDA officials said they did not feel comfortable recommending a recall until they found a package of unopened meat with the bacterium at the plant.
9_17	0.0	That happened Dec. 30.
9_18	0.05555555555555555	After several days of debate among medical experts, CDC officials clearly determined there was a public health threat on Dec. 22, the day of the recall, said Dr. Paul Mead of the CDC.
9_19	0.0	Phil Derfler, a USDA deputy director, suggested there should be legislation allowing the agency to require a recall ``based on the threat to public health rather than what it can show about the content of the food.''
