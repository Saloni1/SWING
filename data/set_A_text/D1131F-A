2_1	0.11396761	The global wildlife trade watchdog agreed Wednesday to regulate sales of red coral, which conservationists say is under threat from overfishing for the jewelry industry.
2_2	0.16890079	"This is the best possible decision to start getting the trade in these corals under some form of international control," said Ernie Cooper, a coral trade expert from wildlife monitoring network TRAFFIC.
2_3	0.16358618	Delegates at the triennial meeting of the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species put the coral on a list of protected wildlife, meaning exporters will now have to prove that the coral was harvested without threatening the species' survival before they can sell it.
2_4	0.15709802	Red coral, also known by its Latin name corallium, is a slow- growing deep-sea coral that grows all over the world but is harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and parts of the Pacific.
2_5	0.14179122	In the Mediterranean, it is gathered by scuba divers but in some other parts of the world fishermen still use trawl nets dragged along the seabed -- a practice that devastates the coral.
2_6	0.11229187	Andy Bruckner of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who drafted the U.S. proposal adopted at the conference, welcomed its acceptance.
2_7	0.13054066	"Red coral is the most valuable and widely traded out of all the coral species, and CITES protection will help ensure the future of the species and the red coral industry," he said.

2_10	0.097893972	Raw coral can sell for US$900 (euro670) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) at auction and finished works of art or pieces of jewelry can cost anywhere from US$20 (euro15) to US$20,000 (euro15,000) depending on their size and quality.
2_11	0.10350199	Part of the reason the coral is so vulnerable is that it grows so slowly -- in some cases just 1.5 millimeters (0.06 inches) or less per year -- takes up to seven years to reach maturity and has low reproduction rates.
2_12	0.09735806	Italian craftsmen from the town of Torre Del Greco near Naples had lobbied against CITES regulating the trade, saying that they had been harvesting it in a sustainable way for 800 years and would continue to do so to preserve their livelihoods.

4_18	0.080526377	Theirs is an uphill battle.
4_19	0.077020592	Many would say corals globally are already so damaged, and so threatened by further environmental degradation, that there is little chance restoration efforts can turn things around.
4_20	0.075679123	Staghorn and elkhorn corals, Nedimyer's principal interests, were once abundant in South Florida, the Bahamas and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
4_21	0.10798615	But since the 1990s they have significantly declined, to the point that last year they were placed on the threatened list, under the Endangered Species Act.
4_22	0.14276252	They are suffering the kinds of environmental disruption that afflict corals around the world.
4_23	0.1254543	"We have lost 25 percent of the world's corals in the last 25 years," David E. Vaughan, director of the Center for Coral Reef Research at Mote, said in an interview, adding that 25 percent more are expected to die in the next decade or two.
4_24	0.03126139	"Sometimes we sound like doomsday sayers," Vaughan said, "but those are the facts."

4_28	0.086765235	Polluted runoff can deprive corals of the clear, oxygen-rich water they need to survive.
4_29	0.077053525	And then there is global warming.
4_30	0.07450131	So far, scientists say, it has had two main effects on coral, both potentially lethal.
4_31	0.043037294	First, as oceans absorb more carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, they become more acidic.
4_32	0.072648393	The acidity makes it more difficult for corals to grow and may even cause them to start to dissolve.
4_33	0.078750995	And as oceans warm, algae that live in corals, and on which they depend, may be killed.
4_34	0.085858023	(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
4_35	0.046623921	David Lackland, a biologist at Mote, tells children who visit that corals live with algae as people might live if they liked asparagus, say, but instead of raising it in gardens they grew it inside their bodies, absorbing it directly as energy and fertilizing it with their waste in a symbiotic relationship.
4_36	0.094912858	Different kinds of corals have different kinds of algae symbionts, but if the algae are threatened, corals are threatened, too.
4_37	0.08250861	Another serious disruption is overfishing.
4_38	0.075402424	Corals need herbivorous fish to keep unwanted algae under control.
4_39	0.095896028	When seaweed-eating fish are gone, "you are going to end up with seaweed blooms," said Nancy Knowlton, director of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and a leader in the World Bank effort.
4_40	0.051416106	"It's been shown that seaweeds release a lot of sugars into the water," she said.
4_41	0.06926935	Because many bacteria need sugars, "you have these bacteria blooms that kill corals."
4_42	0.053593375	Corals also need predators like groupers, snappers, barracudas and even lobsters to prevent the proliferation of coral-eating snails, worms and other organisms.
4_43	0.067717365	Meanwhile, a host of diseases plague coral, many of them poorly understood.
4_44	0.080545743	For example, staghorn and elkhorn coral are vulnerable to so-called white-band disease, in which coral tissue mysteriously decays.
4_45	0.073943703	The disease, which struck the Caribbean in the mid-1990s, kills healthy tissue, leaving only white skeletons.
4_46	0.058687087	It usually progresses quickly, and while it almost never wipes out complete colonies, colonies can be reinfected.
4_47	0.067965883	Scientists do not know for sure what causes the condition, and their suspects -- bacteria, fungi and other microbes -- are present at healthy corals as well as sickly formations, adding to the mystery.
4_48	0.075281954	Corals in South Florida have another big problem, a die-off of sea urchins, which began succumbing wholesale to a mysterious ailment about 20 years ago.
4_49	0.072553251	Urchins graze on unwanted algae, and without them, corals in many areas have been smothered in overgrowth, making it difficult or impossible for them to grow or propagate.

4_51	0.07282434	Nedimyer focuses most of his efforts on coral, something he got into almost by accident several years ago, through his work as a wholesale dealer in aquarium supplies, a business he has operated for 35 years.
4_52	0.072236975	One of his products is "live rock," reef rubble that bacteria colonize.

4_59	0.080636927	When he found broken pieces of coral he stuck them in other pieces of rock, and "sometimes they would live."
4_60	0.079580117	In 2000, at an aquarium in Orlando, he heard a presentation on Pacific coral and learned that "you can cut these things into tiny fragments and glue them to things and they will grow."

4_66	0.090791252	"We found kinds that stick to wetsuits, to hair, to cameras."
4_67	0.08788832	Eventually, they discovered a two-part epoxy glue used in taxidermy.

4_69	0.086648922	And it is white, which looks nice against the sandy bottom.
4_70	0.088840169	For a brief heady moment, he recalled, he thought about the fact that he has government permission to sell coral and considered turning it into a lucrative sideline for his business.
4_71	0.090366115	But then, he said, he started thinking about what had happened to the Keys' reefs since he first encountered them in the 1970s, "when there would be thickets three, four, five feet high and just vast."
4_72	0.093066247	Those kinds of underwater landscapes have just about vanished, he said.
4_73	0.091569477	"So I thought, well, these corals are in trouble.

4_79	0.092827321	That's a lot of growth in six months."
4_80	0.09681366	Knowlton, the coral expert at Scripps, said staghorn coral was among the fastest growing -- up to four inches or so from branch tips in a year, whereas most corals grow only about half an inch a year.
4_81	0.097325029	But, she said, corals that grow quickly are often unusually sensitive to their environment.
4_82	0.092432552	"They can slip from growing really fast to dying really fast," she said.
4_83	0.095513271	At Mote, Lackland maintains and propagates a variety of coral species in tanks, and hopes to emulate Nedimyer with offshore nurseries between Looe Key and American Shoals.
4_84	0.094782735	Like Nedimyer, Lackland, who is 40, parlayed a youthful fascination with marine creatures -- he had corals in tanks in his bedroom as a teenager in Watchung, N.J. -- into his life's work.
4_85	0.096887965	After earning a bachelor's degree in biology, he worked at an aquarium in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., where his one-bedroom apartment had six tank systems filled with coral.

4_89	0.095837955	Eventually, he said, he decided to go to the Florida Keys, "where they have the most hurting ocean, an ocean that's slipping away as far as its coral cover."
4_90	0.097519857	He presented himself at the National Marine Sanctuary, where he learned there might be an opening for a biologist at Mote.
4_91	0.098484536	When he got the job, "I was thrilled," he said.
4_92	0.096665462	Today, he presides over several rooms full of tanks where many species of coral grow on networks of iron pipes.
4_93	0.097959344	Lackland has devised elaborate systems to mimic the flow of ocean currents, the varying pressure of waves and even the coming and going of daylight.
4_94	0.097300788	He feeds his coral oyster larvae and other plankton, which he buys from an aquarium supplier, and he has devised formulas to maintain the proper mineral balance in the water.
4_95	0.099064533	Some of his corals are doing so well they have even spawned in the tanks.
4_96	0.096858119	Like Nedimyer, he is starting corals on concrete disks and establishing them in the water, in his case between Looe Key and American Shoals, near the laboratory.
4_97	0.096808908	Kramer noted that, overall, "corals have managed to deal with many swift changes in the last million and half years."
4_98	0.097137372	He added, "Over these geological time scales, in the long term, corals may be able to handle these climate changes."
4_99	0.10042638	Meanwhile, though, he said, "I think these types of strategies have a real role to play."
4_100	0.098291571	For scientists like Knowlton, the major question is not whether some coral strains might do better than others.
4_101	0.090885702	That is almost a given, she said.
4_102	0.097676703	"The biggest problem is making a difference on a regional scale or even on a large local scale."
4_103	0.096885196	She said people interested in corals should focus on "fixing the things we can fix -- climate action or water quality action or stopping overfishing."
4_104	0.09960138	In interviews, Lackland and Nedimyer separately acknowledged that viewed from any reasonable perspective, the problem is huge and their efforts are small.
4_105	0.090226845	"I am not an ostrich," Lackland said.
4_106	0.089013143	"The facts are really bad."
4_107	0.10122452	But, he added, "If the ocean is really in that bad condition, let's gear up!"
4_108	0.097539592	Nedimyer shares this view even though, as he put it, every day he spends on the project "is one day I can't make a living."
4_109	0.098319897	But one of its major rewards, he said, was its lesson for his daughter Kelly, now 19 and a student at the University of Central Florida, and the Coral Shores students working with him.

5_3	0.15280309	On Wednesday the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) had placed 26 species in the Corallium genus on its Appendix II, protecting them from the unregulated trade which has decimated coral stocks around the world.

6_0	0.089773101	Pink coral, cedar trees, types of fish eaten in Europe and a cuddly, wide-eyed mammal that is prized in Asian medicine are among the animal and plant species that could gain greater protection this year, a UN agency said Wednesday.
6_1	0.14406962	The United Nations agency regulating the trade in endangered species, CITES, unveiled some 40 new government proposals for changes to wildlife trade rules which will be considered at the organisation's conference in June.
6_2	0.12371751	The agency said many of the proposals reflected growing international concern about the accelerating destruction of the world's marine and forest resources through overfishing and excessive logging.
6_3	0.086438674	"Biological diversity faces many threats, ranging from habitat destruction to climate change to unrestrained commercial harvesting for trade," said Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, which administers CITES.
6_4	0.049274924	Potentially the most endearing candidate for a complete ban trade is the Slow Loris, a small furry nocturnal primate from south and southeast Asia.
6_5	0.071571706	Cambodia, which is sponsoring full protection under CITES Appendix I, says the Loris is threatened by a combination of the destruction of its forest habitat and growing demand for traditional medicine and as a pet.
6_6	0.13061369	The requests also include an attempt by the United States to control the trade in pink coral for the first time, because of the overexploitation of tropical coral reefs which have been rendered fragile and bleached by climate change.
6_7	0.079728071	The pink variety of the polyp has been prized in jewellery and for decoration for 5,000 years.
6_8	0.086973228	"Extensive deforestation" of the cedar tree in South and central America, is prompting the European Union to seek trade restrictions under Appendix II for the species, which is valued for its insect and rot resistant wood.
6_9	0.092708322	The EU also wants the trade in the European eels, a popular food in coastal areas of northern Europe, and the spiny dogfish, a type of shark prized in fish and chip shops, to be subject to a permit system and fisheries management, CITES said.
6_10	0.095243068	Germany, which currently holds the European Union presidency, said the spiny dogfish was vulnerable because of its tendency to travel in large schools that are easily trawled by fishing boats and its slow reproductive rate.
6_11	0.098242974	Meanwhile European eel stocks have declined "dramatically" due to overfishing according to CITES.
6_12	0.096736353	Other fish species up for protection due to overexploitation include Brazilian lobsters, while several countries want complete halt in trade in the sawfish, a favourite for traditional medicine.
6_13	0.098338158	A popular item in home aquariums, the striking tropical Bangai cardinal fish, is also a candidate for listing, because about 700,000 to 900,000 of them are collected every year.

7_3	0.12988474	But pollution, warming waters from climate change, commercial fishing, development and ship groundings are jeopardizing them.
7_4	0.16445132	With 84 percent of the United States' coral reefs located along Florida's 1,350 miles (2,175 kilometers) of coastline, officials are moving quickly to protect them.
7_5	0.09472647	On Thursday, Tim Keeney, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary for oceans and atmosphere and a key high-level figure within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, got a firsthand look at reef damage and repair and recovery efforts.
7_6	0.084774646	"Just gorgeous.
7_7	0.027438784	That's impressive," said Michael Sole, Florida's environmental chief, who joined Keeney.
7_8	0.093019579	He had just returned to the boat after scuba diving off Fort Lauderdale, where he viewed elkhorn and staghorn coral, recently listed as endangered species.
7_9	0.045050632	"Taking appropriate measures to improve our understanding is key because you can't manage what you don't understand," Sole said.
7_10	0.051859784	"Our ocean resources pump billions of dollars into our economy."
7_11	0.080768463	The state is managing underwater nurseries to grow coral that will be transplanted onto natural reefs, seeking to end the pumping of treated wastewater into the ocean and plowing ahead with research into artificial reefs.
7_12	0.070383635	Florida is also spending $2 million (euro1.5 million) to remove some 700,000 old tires from the ocean floor off Fort Lauderdale that were dumped there in the 1970s with the intent of creating an artificial reef.
7_13	0.098229126	It didn't work, and now the tires are scouring the ocean floor and wedging against the natural reef, killing coral.
7_14	0.061132111	"The first thing you think when you see it is these things don't belong here.
7_15	0.093616228	It's a wasteland," Keeney said after surveying the tires.
7_16	0.17111657	Scientists warn that up to half of the world's coral reefs could disappear by 2045.
7_17	0.077136813	The reefs serve as breeding grounds for many commercial fisheries, so without them, an important food source for humans could be lost.
7_18	0.081802822	Reefs also serve as natural barriers to tidal surges created by powerful storms.
7_19	0.090058661	Degrading them could put coastal communities at risk.

7_22	0.092482918	Reef-related activities generate more than $4 billion (euro3 billion) for the economy of southeast Florida alone, Dodge said.
7_23	0.11274198	The U.S. Congress is considering the reauthorization of the Coral Reef Conservation Act, which would add another layer of protection for the nation's reef system, Keeney said.
7_24	0.096370326	Under current law, the federal government has no authority to fine boats or ships for running aground on coral reefs that are not located within marine sanctuaries or to penalize people who destroy them, he said.
7_25	0.094677008	"It doesn't allow us to go into areas outside protected areas and hold parties responsible for the damage," Keeney said.
7_26	0.095983615	Reauthorization of the act would create that authority and also build a federal fund to restore damaged reef systems, he said.
7_27	0.090444009	States and counties currently have limited authority.
7_28	0.097910742	There have been 12 major ship groundings on reefs outside Port Everglades, just south of Fort Lauderdale, since 1993.
7_29	0.099710697	The port has three reefs off its shore and narrow channels and tight spots for maneuvering and anchoring among them.

8_0	0.21768052	Caribbean coral species essential to the region's reef ecosystems are at risk of extinction as a result of climate change, according to a new marine life study released Thursday.
8_1	0.13860997	The report by Conservation International found 10 percent of the Caribbean's 62 spectacular reef-building corals -- one of the sea's most spectacular natural resources -- are under threat and candidates for "critically endangered" designations.
8_2	0.12579568	"One of the Atlantic Ocean's most beautiful marine habitats no longer exists in many places because of dramatic increases in coral diseases, mostly caused by climate change and warmer waters," said Dr Michael Smith, director of the Caribbean Biodiversity Initiative at Conservation International.
8_3	0.073494281	A gathering of 23 scientists in March 2007 analyzed data on tropical corals, seagrasses, mangroves and algae -- all fundamental components of healthy marine ecosystems.

8_5	0.099390634	When the coral reefs disappear, so will many other species which rely on reefs for shelter, reproduction and foraging," said Dr Suzanne Livingstone, another marine biologist who contributed to the study.
8_6	0.10148768	The scientists noted that in some well-managed, protected areas of the ocean, human impacts are reduced, allowing most corals to thrive.
9_0	0.086594343	Green sea turtles, cascades of glittering reef fish, blooming coral pillars -- countless travelers have come nose to nose with a thriving undersea universe while on vacation.
9_1	0.14497727	But increasingly, divers and snorkelers are swimming over bleached hunks of coral devastated by shore runoff or overfishing.From the South Pacific to the Caribbean, coral reefs -- which are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems -- are bearing the brunt of climate change and other human-driven activities -- including coastal development, deforestation, and unrestricted tourism.
9_2	0.15690224	Now, many in the tourist industry are trying to halt the damage.
9_3	0.074475331	And it is no wonder.
9_4	0.052735319	The dollars involved in reef-based tourism are significant: Australia's Great Barrier Reef alone draws about 1.9 million visitors a year, supporting a $4.2 billion industry.
9_5	0.20878794	According to the Nature Conservancy, the annual economic value of coral reefs to world tourism is $9.6 billion.
9_6	0.089355623	Growing awareness of environmental issues means that the tourism industry has lately been a partner to conservation efforts in major reef areas.
9_7	0.084050035	Though the Great Barrier is the most famous reef, it is not the most threatened; its extensive marine management program is widely regarded as a model for conservation.
9_8	0.07544375	It includes eco-certification programs for tourism operators within the boundaries of the marine park, environmental tourist fees, large no-take zones, species monitoring, and tourism industry contributions to the Great Barrier Reef's main research center.
9_9	0.14161274	But the world's second-largest barrier reef, the Mesoamerican Reef in the Caribbean, is seriously endangered by coastal development, runoff, and pollution.
9_10	0.065239365	The reef system stretches nearly 700 miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico to the Bay Islands of Honduras.
9_11	0.094814266	And reefs in the Coral Triangle in Southeast Asia -- which reaches from Malaysia to the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands, encompassing some of the planet's most diverse marine habitats -- have been severely damaged by overfishing and destructive practices, including the use of cyanide and dynamite to capture fish.
9_12	0.055009118	In 2004, the nonprofit group Conservation International began a program called the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative, which aims to address the threat that mass tourism poses to the Mesoamerican Reef by engaging hoteliers, developers, cruise lines, and local governments in Mexico, Belize, and Honduras.
9_13	0.062496488	There is special emphasis on the Riviera Maya of Mexico, where, less than nine miles offshore, the island of Cozumel is the world's second most-visited cruise destination after Miami, according to the International Council of Cruise Lines.
9_14	0.076813755	Last year, as part of the Mesoamerican Reef initiative's efforts, the cruise line council began an effort to avoid wastewater discharge by cruise ships in environmentally sensitive areas.
9_15	0.083304779	"This program will ensure that cruise line wastewater is discharged at least four miles from any of the sensitive marine ecosystems within the Mesoamerican Reef system, thereby minimizing the chance such discharges will have negative impact on the long-term health of the reef," said Jamie Sweeting, who oversees Conservation International's work with the travel industry.
9_16	0.06337672	The cruise industry is a particular area of concern, since ships regularly disgorge crowds of passengers into fragile coastal areas that strain to absorb the impact.
9_17	0.077821206	Conservation International estimates that cruise passengers typically make about 2,000 scuba dives in and around Cozumel's surrounding reefs in a single day.
9_18	0.087710188	"We're working with the municipal government, the local dive and water sports association, and the cruise lines themselves, because they all have a vested interest to look after this coral reef," Sweeting said.
9_19	0.085166427	Areas being addressed include the creation of a dedicated snorkeling zone in Cozumel to limit visitor impact to one section of the reef, and ensuring that park management fees are collected and put toward protection and management of marine areas.
9_20	0.07407999	The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative has also begun a program to evaluate and implement good business practices for conserving water and energy, reducing solid waste, and managing chemicals at coastal hotels along the Riviera Maya and in southern Belize.
9_21	0.11363556	Crucial partnerships between conservation groups and the tourism industry have also taken root in the Coral Triangle.
9_22	0.085213788	In developing nations like Indonesia, where human and financial resources are slim, the cooperation of private tourism businesses has been instrumental in accomplishing reef conservation goals.
9_23	0.089276297	For example, Bunaken National Park, in north Sulawesi, is today managed in large part by a local association of dive operators who saw the declining quality of coral (and their livelihood) in the mid-1990s.
9_24	0.10164294	The Nature Conservancy's Coral Triangle Center works at several sites in Indonesia, including the Raja Ampat Islands in Papua and Komodo National Park, a major protected marine area in the Lesser Sunda Islands.
9_25	0.086865694	Komodo is now run by a nonprofit joint venture between the Nature Conservancy and a local tourism company.
9_26	0.08625547	The joint venture, PT Putri Naga Komodo, was established in 2005.
9_27	0.092080229	Founded in 1980, the park is a World Heritage Site and protects the habitat of the Komodo dragon, as well as important whale migration routes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
9_28	0.13572769	The reefs are rich in coral species and home to up to 1,000 species of fish.
9_29	0.095387099	"After a decade supporting conservation in Komodo National Park, the Nature Conservancy recognized the need for self-sufficiency," said Marcus Matthews-Sawyer, director of tourism communications for the joint venture.
9_30	0.10887803	Tourism has helped raise awareness of the destination and of the reefs' biological importance.
9_31	0.09121208	Blast fishing -- using explosives to stun or kill fish -- is now prohibited within the park.
9_32	0.097364998	The ban is credited with a 60 percent increase in hard coral coverage between 1996 and 2002, according to the Coral Triangle Center.
9_33	0.096885315	The collection of conservation fees from tourists, about $15 a stay, is vital to sustaining park management.
9_34	0.10254769	The partnership plans to have Komodo self-financed by park fees by 2012.
9_35	0.099205956	Though Komodo is one of Indonesia's greatest tourism assets -- it is one of the most frequently visited nature reserves in the country -- conservation work there is also necessary to protect young fish that are a source for surrounding fishing grounds.
9_36	0.09960062	Enforcement of the park zoning system, which restricts access to certain parts of the reefs, continues to be a challenge because of limited resources.
9_37	0.098843632	But a major goal of the tourism partnership is supporting sustainable community use of the reef area, which includes providing alternative livelihoods to destructive fishing.
9_38	0.10132507	All three reef systems -- the Great Barrier Reef, the Mesoamerican Reef and the Coral Triangle -- are jeopardized by the threat of global warming, which kills coral and leads to a bleaching effect.
9_39	0.096989484	And while tourism cannot solve the problem of rising sea temperatures, the industry's cooperation to eliminate specific pressures -- by establishing a well-enforced no-take zone, or reducing wastewater pollution, for example -- helps reefs recover from bleaching and disease.
9_40	0.096166519	The contribution of conservation fees to support the protected areas, which many businesses have long resisted, is also important.
9_41	0.097463001	To keep coral reefs from disappearing as quickly as they have in recent years, people need to be involved and educated on every level from local government to hotel developers to cruise lines, said Sweeting of Conservation International.
9_42	0.097857997	"It took Cancun 35 years to develop to this massive size, and it took less than a decade for the Riviera Maya," he said.
9_43	0.10354441	"But nature will not let you get away with it."
