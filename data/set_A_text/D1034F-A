0_12	0.0	The report evaluated the status of all known species of amphibians -- 5,743 of them -- and concluded that 1,856, or 32 percent, were critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction.
0_13	0.0	Too little is known about 1,300 of the species to determine their status, but scientists believe that most of them are in peril, too.

2_0	0.05555555555555555	Scientists who compared frogs collected over the past 150 years have discovered a dramatic increase in hermaphrodites during the times when contamination from the pesticide DDT and other organochlorine chemicals was widespread.
2_1	0.0	Frogs with both male and female reproductive organs were rare in the 19th century and early 20th century but abundant during the 1950s, when the largest volumes of the popular chemicals were used.
2_2	0.0	The findings, reported Tuesday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, adds to the growing evidence that a variety of pesticides and industrial chemicals can alter the sex hormones of animals.
2_3	0.0	The ability of chemicals to mimic or block estrogen and testosterone, which are critical for normal sexuality and reproduction, is considered one of the most disturbing discoveries in environmental science of the past decade.
2_4	0.0	Scientists believe that the phenomenon has been occurring for decades but wasn't documented in wildlife until the early 1990s, when it was observed first in Florida alligators and then many other species.
2_5	0.0	Toxicologists and veterinarians at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, led by Amy Reeder, examined the reproductive organs of 814 cricket frogs collected in Illinois between 1852 and 2001 and stored at natural history museums.
2_6	0.0	Studying endocrine disruption of animals dating back over a century is novel.
2_7	0.05	Cricket frogs, once abundant, declined dramatically around Chicago and other regions in the 1960s, and the scientists found that the times and places with high rates of hermaphrodites, also called intersexes, overlapped with when and where the frogs disappeared in Illinois.
2_8	0.0	The scientists theorize that DDT, industrial compounds called PCBs, and other contaminants had an anti-estrogenic effect, reducing the proportion of females and causing them to develop skewed sex organs, triggering a population crash, particularly in the Chicago region.
2_9	0.16666666666666666	Frogs and other amphibians have been vanishing worldwide over the past few decades.
2_10	0.0	``These guys have been around a long time, since before the dinosaurs, and they are declining all over the place,'' said Val Beasley, a co-author of the study and a professor of ecotoxicology at the university's College of Veterinary Medicine.
2_11	0.0	``Endocrine disruptors seem to be a factor, but certainly not the only factor.''
2_12	0.13333333333333333	Frogs are considered a key sentinel for effects of environmental degradation because they undergo a vulnerable time of metamorphosis and spend most of their time in water, where pollutants accumulate.
2_13	0.0	Environmental Health Perspectives science editor Jim Burkhart said frogs ``may show the effects of ecological change more quickly or more obviously than other species.''
2_14	0.0	The new study has limitations.
2_15	0.0	The team did not measure individual animals for contaminants because archived samples cannot be reliably tested.
2_16	0.1111111111111111	As a result, there could be other explanations for the hermaphrodites, such as factory and vehicle emissions or other environmental changes.
2_17	0.0	Also, the scientists could not compare frogs from the same lakes or ponds over time.
2_18	0.0	The highest rates of intersex animals were found in frogs collected from 1946 through 1959, when large volumes of DDT were used for mosquito control in Illinois.
2_19	0.0	The area around Chicago had four times more intersex frogs than southern Illinois.
2_20	0.0	Between 1852 and 1929, one intersex frog was found in the 84 collected.
2_21	0.0	Then, beginning in the 1930s, the intersex rate increased.
2_22	0.0	Between 1946 and 1959, 17 out of 153, or 11 percent, were intersex.
2_23	0.0	Recent rates of hermaphrodites were the lowest of any period studied except for 1852-1929.
2_24	0.0	Out of 339 collected from 1980 through 1996, there were nine intersex frogs, or less than 3 percent.
2_25	0.0	DDT and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were banned in the 1970s in the United States and although they remain in the environment, levels are low now in most areas.
2_26	0.0	Nevertheless, the scientists reported, ``we cannot conclude that the era of endocrine disruption in cricket frogs has come to an end.''
2_27	0.0	The severity of the current problem is unknown, Beasley said, ``because you can't collect where the intersex rate was high.
2_28	0.0	There aren't any frogs left in those areas to collect.''
2_29	0.0	Also, males still outnumber females, while it was the opposite before 1930.
2_30	0.0	Atrazine, a herbicide widely used today on corn, might also contribute to the sexuality problems and decline of the frogs, the report says.
2_31	0.0	Beasley said the intersex rate in central Illinois, where atrazine is used, is twice as high as in the southern areas, where atrazine use is low.

4_14	0.16666666666666666	Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on land and in water.
4_15	0.6666666666666666	Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat.
4_16	0.125	The third is more enigmatic, but it has resulted in catastrophic declines, often linked to a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, particularly in cooler habitats that are experiencing drought.
4_17	0.0	Surveys showed the amphibian population of Costa Rica's Monteverde Cloud Forest, for example, was stable until 1987.
4_18	0.07692307692307693	The next year it began to crash and by 1989, 40 percent of its amphibian species had gone extinct, including the striking golden toad.
4_19	0.0	Stuart said it is now widely believed chytridiomycosis played a pivotal role in the devastation, which took place in a dry period.
4_20	0.05555555555555555	The fact that more than 200 amphibian species are showing rapid enigmatic declines is alarming, Stuart said, because it is probably linked to recent disruptions in rain and storm patterns.
4_21	0.6	``This is a wake-up call to us that we don't have a grip on the massive climate change that's going on,'' he said.
4_22	0.1	Humans are responsible for amphibians' decline in other regions of the world, including China, where many are sought as a delicacy.
4_23	0.0	The Chinese giant salamander -- at six feet the largest amphibian in the world -- sells for at least $300 on the street and makes for several meals, and it has now disappeared from nearly all its range.

8_1	0.05	Cairns Frog Hospital in northern Queensland state, which at times had as many as 200 sick amphibians in its care, has had to close down because of unsustainable costs, founder Deborah Pergolotti told AFP on Friday.
8_2	0.0	"We're not taking in any more cases," she said, adding that the hospital had been hit by an increase in sick frogs being brought in and a reluctance by Australians to pay for the medical treatment.
8_3	0.0	While some frogs cost only 20-30 dollars (US dollars) to treat, others can cost more than 100 dollars, Pergolotti said.
8_4	0.3333333333333333	She warned of an increase in the number of previously unrecognised frog diseases which could indicate broader environmental degradation.
8_5	0.0	Typical symptoms included changes in skin colour, lethargy and weight loss, she said.
8_6	0.0	"These are new and unrecognised diseases.
8_7	0.0	Because we know so little about them, we get as much lab work done as we can afford," Pergolotti said.
8_8	0.0	However the hospital, which she runs out of her two-bedroom house, could no longer afford these tests as well as the live insects for meals, vet fees and medicine.
8_9	0.0	The hospital, which is part of the Frog Decline Reversal Project, received no government funding, she said, adding this may have been because frogs were not "iconic" Australian animals such as koalas or kangaroos.
8_10	0.0	"There may be an issue with frogs, that they are not warm and fuzzy," she said.
9_0	0.0	Gerardo de la Cruz, a 42-year-old farmer, is one of thousands who spent two weeks blockading a U.S.-run gold mine in the Andes, the latest example of the uneasy relationship between Peru's rural poor and the mining industry.
9_1	0.0	The siege of Latin America's largest gold mine was lifted Sept. 17 after Peru's Mining Ministry struck a deal to postpone the search for ore pending a study of the impact mining could have on the water supply to de la Cruz's village.
9_2	0.0	But the Yanacocha mining company, 51-percent owned by Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp., still has a serious image problem to overcome.
9_3	0.0	"The mine here is interested only in money _ hauling off gold _ and nothing else," de la Cruz said.
9_4	0.0	The blockade of the mine's access road was sparked by fears that new mining on Cerro Quilish, the mountain where Yanacocha had started exploratory drilling, could deplete and contaminate water supplies.
9_5	0.0	Yanacocha isn't the first mining company to run up against broad public opposition.
9_6	0.0	The government last year withdrew permission for Canada's Manhattan Minerals Corp. to develop the Tambogrande gold and copper project in northern Peru that called for uprooting a third of nearby townspeople.
9_7	0.0	Yanacocha, acknowledges it underestimated the concern over water, but points to an independent study that said its operations pose no immediate health threat and isn't to blame for decreased water supplies.
9_8	0.0	Mining is key to Peru's economy, which has been growing at about 4 percent annually since President Alejandro Toledo took office in 2001.
9_9	0.0	Mining provides about half of Peru's more than US$11 billion (euro8.9 billion) in exports this year, but directly employs only about 70,000 of Peru's 27 million people, mostly in remote regions.
9_10	0.0	For years, Yanacocha has provoked resentment among the area's 140,000 inhabitants, in part because it hired only about 1,260 of them.
9_11	0.0	For many like de la Cruz, who ekes out a living raising a few head of cattle and growing potatoes and carrots, Yanacocha represents only the downside of boomtown economics: a higher cost of living and increased crime and prostitution.
9_12	0.0	But water is the most explosive issue for farmers, who accuse Yanacocha of contaminating and drying up water sources that irrigate crops and sustain dairy production.
9_13	0.0	They claim some waters downstream from the mine are now putrid, and that the company has refused to reopen one diverted irrigation canal, leaving 160 families dry.
9_14	0.0	Community relations were also greatly damaged in June 2000 when a mine contractor spilled 335 pounds (150 kilograms) of mercury in a small town south of Cajamarca, sickening 1,100 people whose damage claims are now in U.S. courts.
9_15	0.0	Yanacocha spent US$14 million (euro11.3 million) cleaning up the spill.
9_16	0.0	"The frogs, ducks and trout we used to have in the Rio Grande are gone," said Segundo Briones, a community leader, referring to one of three rivers that drop down from the mining operations.
9_17	0.0	"We won't be fooled anymore."
9_18	0.0	Since 1993, Yanacocha has operated an open pit mine on a plateau about 13,000 feet (3,940 meters) above sea level, nine miles (15 kilometers) from Cajamarca, a small Spanish colonial city 350 miles (560 kilometers) north of Lima.
9_19	0.0	The company uses cyanide and massive amounts of water to extract gold from ore piled on impermeable barriers designed to prevent toxins from seeping into the ground.
9_20	0.0	Yanacocha blames water scarcity on drought and points to the study that was commissioned by the World Bank and completed last year by Colorado-based Stratus Consulting Inc.
9_21	0.0	The 20-month study determined the mine didn't cause water supplies to drop, and posed no "imminent short-term danger of illness or death to people, livestock, or crops."
9_22	0.0	It said the mine could be responsible for killing fish and other water life, but added that the greatest health threat was from human and animal waste.
9_23	0.0	Newmont, Yanacocha's owner, has global operations that make it one of the world's biggest mining companies.
9_24	0.0	Its spokesman, Doug Hock, said Yanacocha underestimated water concerns but was eager to work more closely with the community on the new water study.
9_25	0.0	He said Yanacocha, which yielded just under 3 million ounces (84 million grams) of gold last year, paid about US$140 million (euro112.8 million) in Peruvian income tax, of which half goes to Cajamarca's government.
9_26	0.0	In the last 11 years, Yanacocha independently financed the construction of 35 schools, built miles (kilometers) of road and brought electricity and drinking water to remote communities, Hock said, adding the company has poured tens of millions of dollars into Cajamarca's economy through local suppliers to the mine.
9_27	0.0	Still, Antonio Brack, a leading Peruvian ecologist, blames Yanacocha and the government in distant Lima, which he says gives short shrift to the region's traditions and water needs and thinks of its people as "poor peasants, period."
