0_3	0.21177606	The same panel that found Juan Alvarez guilty of 11 counts of first-degree murder was asked Monday to recommend whether he be put to death or sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

0_6	0.15360672	In closing arguments of the death penalty phase of his trial, a prosecutor asked for the death sentence, depicting the 29-year- old Alvarez as a selfish man who turned his back on every opportunity offered to him when he came to the United States after a childhood in Mexico.
0_7	0.076085716	"He had a lot going for him.

0_9	0.075077471	"He feels he has a right to do whatever he wants to do," the prosecutor said.
0_10	0.1761797	Monaghan said that Alvarez ripped apart the lives of families whose loved ones were killed in the derailment and that he had forefeited his right to live.
0_11	0.098377558	Defense attorney Michael Belter argued that Alvarez's childhood of abuse by a father who was a "monster" and a mother who tried to abort him shaped him into a mentally disturbed man who sought refuge in methamphetamine addiction.
0_12	0.072262471	"To suggest he is anything but a troubled person with deep-seated mental illness is to ignore the obvious," Belter said.
0_13	0.11616575	"From the moment he was conceived he was unwanted and unloved."
0_14	0.12903581	He reminded jurors of testimony that Alvarez was beaten relentlessly by his father, that he tried to commit suicide when he was just a child and that he saw his pregnant mother beaten until she had a miscarriage.
0_15	0.13178023	"This leads to lifelong depression," Belter said, citing Alvarez's testimony that he was hearing voices in the weeks before the derailment and that he set out to kill himself that day, not to kill others.
0_16	0.11659208	"Mr. Alvarez did not intend to kill," Belter said.
0_17	0.094440634	"That was not in his heart that day.

0_21	0.10182818	Of Alvarez, he said, "He is a man for whom death is not warranted.

1_3	0.20183876	Alvarez said he poured gas over himself and his Jeep, took out a lighter and then decided he did not want to burn himself to death because it would be too painful.
1_4	0.27486556	He said he then drove onto railroad tracks northeast of Los Angeles in Glendale, hoping a train would smash into his vehicle and kill him quickly.

3_10	0.054473546	"We are not here to offer any excuses or justifications," he said.
3_11	0.052399504	The testimony given Thursday presented a tragic family from the border town of Mexicali, where the seeds of Alvarez's violence can be traced.
3_12	0.082972441	There, the Juan Alvarez Sr. family carried out unspeakable acts of extreme machismo and dominance over loved ones.
3_13	0.12141695	From the time he was a child, Alvarez was mercilessly beaten for no apparent reason by his father, using fists, belts and electrical cords, several relatives testified.

4_1	0.30583455	Having recently won a murder conviction for Juan Manuel Alvarez in Glendale's 2005 Metrolink train disaster, prosecutors kicked off their arguments Monday trying to persuade jurors to sentence the Compton handyman to death.
4_2	0.089531788	After watching gruesome photos and hearing emotional testimony from loved ones of the victims, some jurors were brought to tears as the prosecution pushed its case forward.
4_3	0.17339896	"Life without parole is not justice for the 11 victims," Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham told the nine women and three men who will decide Alvarez's fate.
4_4	0.053425238	As prosecutors continued, the jury could hear the sobs and wails of relatives of Leonardo Romero of Newport Beach.
4_5	0.41737425	Romero, 53, was one of the 11 killed when Alvarez drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.
4_6	0.083619817	When prosecutors showed a photograph of Romero -- a former Marine and father of three, taken shortly after his death -- the family was overcome with emotion.
4_7	0.020377942	One juror wiped tears streaming down her cheeks with a tissue and calmed herself by cooling her face with an Asian-style fan.
4_8	0.093486321	Alvarez, 29, sitting dispassionately next to his attorneys, looked at the witnesses during their testimony and occasionally glanced at the photographs that prosecutors displayed on a large screen hanging from a wall in the courtroom.
4_9	0.082469532	The jury appeared equally moved later when prosecutors presented their first two witnesses -- the mother and younger brother of James Tutino, 47, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who was among the victims.
4_10	0.090432435	Maureen Tutino narrated a slide show of her family's photographs that prosecutor John Monaghan presented to jurors, showing the central role James Tutino had occupied in the lives of his loved ones and the void his death had created.
4_11	0.05905437	"He was kind of the sunshine of our life," said an emotionally wrought Maureen Tutino, "and we miss that."
4_12	0.052009144	Tutino said one of James' sons, Nick, will be sworn in as a sheriff's deputy July 17 and will be given his father's badge number.
4_13	0.054252697	Tony Tutino, who followed his brother's footsteps into law enforcement, recounted the draining ordeal of learning of James' death -- and then the most difficult part: never being "able to go say goodbye to my brother."
4_14	0.066636012	"Because of the injuries he suffered, I had to say my goodbyes through a coffin, and that's the most difficult thing for me.
4_15	0.084207373	I'll regret that for the rest of my life."
4_16	0.1531886	Later in the penalty phase of the trial, Alvarez's wife, Carmen, and his brother Beto are expected to ask jurors to spare his life.
4_17	0.075491888	The jury is not expected to reach a verdict on whether to recommend life in prison or death for Alvarez until at least late next week.
4_18	0.41491064	Alvarez was convicted June 26 of 11 counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson.
4_19	0.13640211	The jury also found true the special circumstance of multiple murders, which makes Alvarez eligible for the death penalty.
4_20	0.14158288	The train derailment also injured 180 people.
4_21	0.12413549	Prosecutors want the jury to recommend that Alvarez be executed instead of spending the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole.
4_22	0.085246482	"Life without parole is not an adequate, appropriate punishment," Brougham told jurors.
4_23	0.094678482	"The defendant deserves the greater punishment."
4_24	0.10485754	In her closing argument, Brougham presented profiles of each of the 11 people who died, saying family members and friends would attest to the loss and tragedy caused by their deaths.
4_25	0.097883105	"You can only begin to imagine the damage that this man has caused," Brougham said of the victims.
4_26	0.093643059	"Each was a unique individual with a future, with a family, with hopes, with dreams."
4_27	0.095503153	Alvarez's attorneys deferred their argument until they begin presenting the defense case, possibly later this week.
4_28	0.10482887	In addition to Alvarez family members, defense attorneys are expected to elicit testimony from psychiatrists in an attempt to portray the convicted killer in the sympathetic light of a troubled man who was abused as a child by his father and uncle.
4_29	0.097371432	Possibly preparing for that, prosecutors reminded jurors that Alvarez's brother and sister had also been abused as children, but that they, like most children who have been abused, did not wind up as mass murderers.
4_30	0.096422187	"He told you himself he had homicidal thoughts that morning," Brougham reminded jurors about Alvarez's testimony.
4_31	0.098042682	"It's not an accident that these people were murdered by him."
4_32	0.097437983	Alvarez, according to Brougham, had acted as a man bent on destruction with no sense of conscience about the havoc he would cause.
4_33	0.097593829	Brougham also reminded jurors of testimony that while in jail, Alvarez had dealt drugs, intimidated prisoners and engaged in other behavior inconsistent with a person truly sorry for his actions.
4_34	0.089490932	"That is not a remorseful, regretful person," she said.
4_35	0.097004526	"Every time the defense asks you for mercy, think of his conduct in jail.

7_5	0.14425857	About 180 other people were injured.

7_7	0.16427165	Playing a slide show featuring photos of the victims when they were alive, followed by shots of their bodies in the wreckage, Los Angeles County prosecutors said there is no doubt that Alvarez is guilty of murder for dousing his SUV with gasoline, leaving it on railroad tracks in Glendale and watching the carnage unfold.
7_8	0.31542051	"On that day, Mr. Alvarez murdered 11 people," Monaghan said.
7_9	0.29854111	The defense argued that Alvarez's only intent that morning was to kill himself.
7_10	0.13853435	While he's responsible for setting off a "perfect storm" of escalating events that resulted in the death of 11 people, that doesn't make him a murderer, said Thomas Kielty, Alvarez's defense lawyer.
7_11	0.13732862	"Juan Alvarez was looking for a place to light himself on fire," said Kielty about the reason Alvarez initially drove his Jeep south, well past the legal traffic barrier at the train crossing at Chevy Chase Drive, between Los Angeles and Glendale.
7_12	0.15850339	He then decided that getting hit by a train would be a more efficient way to kill himself, his attorney said.
7_13	0.10013752	"Juan Alvarez never imagined that a train would derail or that anybody would die other than himself," Kielty said.
7_14	0.10453655	Alvarez, 29, with shorter hair and a goatee, wore a cream-color suit at the opening of his trial.

7_19	0.093923678	Alvarez's methamphetamine use was so bad and he was so delusional that he thought the CIA was following him and that his wife had a slew of lovers, including one who secretly slept with the couple in their bed, prompting Alvarez to sleep with a knife, Kielty said.

7_26	0.12153719	Cathryn Brogham, deputy district attorney, said Alvarez's actions that day were part of a consistent pattern in which he tried to get his estranged wife's attention, this time by killing people.
7_27	0.094968785	"He could have simply walked in front of that train," Brogham said.
7_28	0.093937823	"He didn't just go jump off a bridge.
7_29	0.097517284	He did not go drive his vehicle off a mountain."
7_30	0.10536075	The defense claims that Alvarez changed his mind about the suicide and tried unsuccessfully to back the jeep off the tracks, but the vehicle was stuck.
7_31	0.10098624	For Henry Romero, whose uncle Leonardo Romero was killed in the crash, there's nothing the defense can say to convince him of Alvarez's innocence.
7_32	0.096408837	"Blatant murder is what I think it is," Romero said.
7_33	0.096991539	The family is involved in a lawsuit against the Metrolink, saying that the push method used to propel the Metrolink 100 -- where the engine is behind the passenger cars -- was unsafe.
7_34	0.097578075	Metrolink is fighting the suit on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe.
7_35	0.097540489	And in 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be impractical and expensive.

8_0	0.31340564	The man who caused the 2005 Metrolink train derailment that left 11 dead was "violent" and "dangerous" and considered killing people in the days leading up to the crash, he said Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.
8_1	0.34225966	Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan pounded Juan Manuel Alvarez for details about threats he admitted making to kill or injure his then-estranged wife, his cousin and others before he parked his SUV on railroad tracks in Glendale, causing the Jan. 26, 2005, collision.
8_2	0.074846725	"So you were mad," Monaghan said.
8_3	0.046187771	"So you said you were going to kill somebody, is that what you're telling this jury?"
8_4	0.20707611	Alvarez shot back that it appeared that Monaghan was trying to say he intended to kill people on the train, which he denies.
8_5	0.38252058	Alvarez, 29, faces 11 counts of murder, one count each of train wrecking and arson, as well as special-circumstance allegations of multiple murder and train wrecking.
8_6	0.20632521	If convicted, he could face the death penalty.
8_7	0.078895476	The prosecution's cross-examination is scheduled to continue this morning.
8_8	0.11389689	During his second day of testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court, Alvarez said he was in good spirits when he woke up that January morning, even taking time to water his landlord's roses before driving off for a meeting about a job.
8_9	0.091438945	Alvarez was an admitted methamphetamine user at the time of the crash, although he testified that it had been three or four days since he had used the drug, even though he initially told a doctor it had been longer because he was ashamed and afraid it would make him look bad.
8_10	0.12556316	That morning, Alvarez, a man who defense witnesses have testified hallucinated that his wife's phantom lover slept in their bed and could fly, thought his wife and her lover were in the back seat of his vehicle, mocking him.
8_11	0.12411288	Under earlier questioning Tuesday from defense attorney Thomas Kielty, Alvarez said that's when he decided to douse himself with gasoline and kill himself.
8_12	0.15238281	He said he ditched that plan because he thought it would be "too painful," and decided to kill himself by parking his SUV on the train tracks instead.
8_13	0.10081811	But he changed his mind again, he testified Tuesday, and wanted to live for his children, but couldn't get the stuck SUV off the tracks.
8_14	0.098656739	Wednesday, he admitted to Monaghan that he has repeatedly lied to people, and the prosecutor noted that in recent months, Alvarez told a doctor he thought that January morning about killing his wife at work "and everybody else."
8_15	0.090044047	"I probably meant everybody else that was spying on me, the people that were following me," he said.
8_16	0.090845035	The day began with Kielty continuing his direct examination, in which Alvarez admitted that while in custody, he has illegally stored razor blades, sold prescription medicine and made a batch of "pruno" -- a homemade alcoholic brew.
8_17	0.095783114	Alvarez also admitted passing a friend heroin that had been smuggled in by a new inmate, as well as using extortion and threats against another inmate, a man he said was in custody for child molestation.
8_18	0.10063958	In his questioning, Kielty pointed out that Alvarez had been recorded in jail saying he was drug-free and didn't intend on using drugs, in part, because they caused him to hallucinate and "get crazy."
8_19	0.093032364	"I think I'm better now and I'm afraid to take anything," Alvarez said.
8_20	0.095902059	But just Wednesday morning, Alvarez took anti-depression medication, he admitted under cross-examination.
8_21	0.097099807	And Monaghan highlighted Alvarez's jailhouse problems as proof that he hasn't changed, quoting from a recorded phone conversation in which Alvarez told someone he extorted two $10.75 phone cards and a bag of coffee from another inmate under threats of harm.
8_22	0.09842662	"Didn't you tell this inmate if he didn't pay you, he would get 'f----- up,'?" Monaghan asked.
8_23	0.089415459	"Are you still dangerous?"
8_24	0.08939665	Alvarez's response: "I don't consider myself dangerous."

9_2	0.13576983	The 51-year-old Shadow Hills man was headed south on Metrolink 100, catching a little shut-eye on his way to his job at Los Angeles City Hall.

9_8	0.080145697	Three years, one arrest, 11 deaths and dozens of lawsuits later, the families of the worst disaster in Metrolink history hope their long quest for justice is close to an end.
9_9	0.27203968	The Los Angeles Superior Court has scheduled the criminal trial of Juan Manuel Alvarez for March 24.
9_10	0.27590494	The 25-year-old Compton man, who drove his SUV onto the tracks at Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale, stands accused of 11 counts of murder, along with arson and train-wrecking charges.
9_11	0.2118617	If convicted, he faces the death penalty.
9_12	0.1129372	Allegedly distraught and suicidal, the handyman lodged the SUV on the tracks north of downtown Los Angeles, doused it with gasoline and waited.
9_13	0.078861472	As Train 100 bore down, he leapt out of the passenger side and fled.
9_14	0.064239877	Pushed by a massive locomotive, the three-car train bucked upward and crashed down atop the Jeep.
9_15	0.050725233	Its front car skewed wildly to the west, knocking into a Union Pacific freight on the next track.
9_16	0.081766654	As its front toppled to the side, its rear cars smacked into the northbound Metrolink Train 901.
9_17	0.049881443	When Toby finally oriented himself, debris pinned his leg to the ground.
9_18	0.053808728	Someone pulled the stuff off him, but when he tried to get up, he crumpled.
9_19	0.031424153	His leg shattered, he managed to pull himself out the door.
9_20	0.084834472	Eventually, he'd learn to walk again with the aid of a horse- head-top cane, but at the time, all he could think was that he was about to die.
9_21	0.034755408	Fire erupted, fueled by 5,000 gallons of diesel that spewed out across the crash zone.
9_22	0.042203776	Police, fire crews and regular, everyday citizens rushed to the scene to pull commuters to safety.
9_23	0.072141893	By day's end, rescuers retrieved 11 dead bodies from the wreckage and marked 180 wounded.
9_24	0.12000257	Alvarez, who'd watched the carnage unfold from beside the tracks, tried to kill himself a second time, cutting his wrists and stabbing himself in the chest with scissors.
9_25	0.054985406	Glendale police found his wallet near the scene and arrested him at a friend's house.
9_26	0.073674837	At first, they called the crash a suicide attempt gone horribly awry.
9_27	0.14910801	Later, they alleged that Alvarez's motive was actually a bizarre attempt to win the attention of his estranged wife.
9_28	0.11808505	Alvarez's defense team, Michael Belter and Thomas Kielty, doesn't deny he drove the SUV onto the tracks.
9_29	0.097722325	But they place the blame for the deaths on Metrolink and its practice of pushing trains with the locomotive at the rear.
9_30	0.11409156	"Juan never intended to derail or burn the train," they wrote in a prepared statement.
9_31	0.061835028	"Like everyone else, he believed that a locomotive would obliterate his Jeep and just keep going.
9_32	0.11576142	Juan, whose family friend was killed by a train at a grade crossing a couple of years earlier, thought the train always wins.
9_33	0.066699461	He deeply regrets having unintentionally harmed the victims of this tragic accident."
9_34	0.088513352	They're not the only ones blaming the agency.
9_35	0.066025261	More than five dozen plaintiffs went after Metrolink in civil court.
9_36	0.091756095	Some settled early, but nearly 60 remain.
9_37	0.085734164	Trial is set for July 14.
9_38	0.095956009	It will start with three separate cases -- one on behalf of the survivors of a passenger killed in the crash, one for a man seriously injured and the final for a woman with minor injuries.
9_39	0.10039475	Metrolink officials argue that the agency was not at fault and that commuters should not fear getting on the trains.
9_40	0.081561087	"It is an extremely safe and reliable form of transportation, not to diminish in any way the tragedy that the families of these victims suffered," said Denise Tyrrell, Metrolink spokeswoman.
9_41	0.094016362	"Everybody knows what caused the Glendale wreck -- or I should say, who caused it."
9_42	0.091403035	Metrolink is fighting on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe, and it still uses the push-pull method on all trains.
9_43	0.1004924	In 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be too impractical and expensive.
9_44	0.083967404	The money from the lawsuit, many plaintiffs agree, is secondary.
9_45	0.08697963	They want Metrolink to stop pushing trains and to install better security measures around crossings.
9_46	0.086907183	"For some families, it's like it happened yesterday -- especially for the young mothers and widows," said Clark Aristei, an attorney for the plaintiffs.

9_48	0.088353589	It's the subtle things that re-stimulate the terror -- these people just can't escape them for the rest of their lives."
9_49	0.10124801	In the years leading up to the crash, Thomas Ormiston, who drove Amtrak and Metrolink trains, grew more and more uncomfortable riding in the front car when the train was being pushed from behind.
9_50	0.092284158	He called it the "coffin car."
9_51	0.10561327	On the day of the crash, the veteran conductor was in what he thought was the safer locomotive of Train 901.

9_63	0.1060353	Yes, Mr. Alvarez was involved, but Metrolink isn't admitting any guilt.
