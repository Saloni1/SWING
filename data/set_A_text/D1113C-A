1_2	0.22756882	South Africa has been hugely successful in managing its elephant populations, once on the verge of extinction in some parts of the country.
1_3	0.05392307	But it has now become a victim of its own success and herds are growing at the rate of more than 5 percent a year and expected to double by 2020, threatening the delicate balance of nature.

2_1	0.14414629	An international effort to halt the illegal killing of elephants for their ivory tusks has all but collapsed in most of Africa, leaving officials and advocates alarmed about the survival of the species.
2_2	0.052924831	A study, to be released Tuesday, estimates that as many as 23,000 animals were slaughtered last year alone.
2_3	0.090671304	A team of wildlife and law enforcement experts concluded that a widely hailed 1989 ban on international sales of ivory has been overwhelmed in the face of exploding demand for ivory in Japan and newly rich China and declining support for anti-poaching programs.
2_4	0.12785196	``Right now, things are really much worse than before the ban," said Samuel Wasser of the University of Washington, lead author of the report funded jointly by the United States government and several nonprofit groups.
2_5	0.075137355	``Almost half of Africa's elephants had been slaughtered in the eight years before the ban, but now the situation is even more extreme because the number of animals is so much lower to begin with," he said.
2_6	0.058857686	``And unlike in the late `80s, the public has forgotten about this issue."
2_7	0.067487625	Wasser said poaching poses a renewed threat to the survival of regional herds in many countries and to the entire subspecies of forest elephants, which he said is now being ``annihilated" in central Africa.
2_8	0.094964763	Wasser said reports of a rebound in elephant numbers had produced a distorted view of the situation.
2_9	0.12883295	Of the roughly 400,000 elephants in the African wild, he said, about 130,000 are in Botswana, where they are well protected to the point that they have overbred.
2_10	0.092374702	Of the 270,000 elephants elsewhere in Africa, more than 23,000 -- nearly one in 10 -- were killed last year alone, the researchers estimated.
2_11	0.083995722	The estimate is based on the 5,600 pounds of ivory confiscated in a dozen international seizures in the year ended August 2006, and an assumption by law enforcement officials that they seize only 10 percent of all smuggled contraband.
2_12	0.049485512	Ivory is in demand for jewelry and, most commonly, for prized ``hankos" used to stamp personal seals and signatures in parts of East Asia.
2_13	0.07476644	``This is a very complex situation because people read these days about elephant overpopulation in places like Botswana, and how elephants are coming more and more into deadly contact with people," Wasser said.
2_14	0.080795414	``But that's one small piece of the story.
2_15	0.085364456	Overwhelmingly, what we have across Africa is a widespread slaughter of elephants that is getting worse by the day."
2_16	0.098996537	The report said the ban on international ivory sales was effective at first, in large part because wealthy nations provided funds to police game parks and go after poachers.
2_17	0.10214096	Elephant populations rebounded substantially -- especially in southern Africa -- but as more exceptions to the ban were allowed and money to the fight poachers was cut back, illegal killings resumed.
2_18	0.085505668	Compounding the problem, ivory smuggling has become increasingly the province of organized crime, with narcotics and other contraband often being shipped with the tusks.
2_19	0.087060156	Ivory prices have skyrocketed, Wasser said, and the incentives for killing elephants for their tusks have never been higher.
2_20	0.11201578	Wasser's report, published in the online version of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also described a unique effort to determine the origins of 532 unusually large tusks confiscated in Singapore in 2002.
2_21	0.1015318	Using DNA analysis, the group led by Wasser determined that the tusks came from African savannah elephants similar to those found in and around the nation of Zambia.
2_22	0.093949302	(Begin Optional Trim)
2_23	0.089691439	The seizure coincided with a request by the Zambian government for permission to sell tusks it had in storage.
2_24	0.098156597	The United Nations treaty that banned international ivory sales in 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), allows limited sales of tusks harvested from animals that die naturally if the home government can demonstrate it is doing a good job of controlling poaching.
2_25	0.10176378	In its request, Zambia said 135 elephants had been illegally killed in the country in the past decade, but the researchers estimated that between 3,000 and 6,500 Zambian elephants had been killed for their tusks in the short period before the Singapore shipment.
2_26	0.11012544	Much of the funding for the DNA analysis came from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's African Elephant Conservation program, established by Congress in 1988.
2_27	0.11892981	The study was funded primarily by the agency and the International Fund for Animal Welfare.
2_28	0.092656223	(End Optional Trim)
2_29	0.096825321	Wasser and other authors, who include a member of Interpol and officials at African conservation programs, said an aggressive and well-funded anti-poaching program could be highly effective now because the DNA testing can pinpoint where the animals are being killed.
2_30	0.097430625	The report also said an education program in East Asia is essential to curb the demand for ivory.
2_31	0.099034893	``I don't think people in China and Japan fully understand the crisis that their ivory purchases have caused," Wasser said.
2_32	0.098004704	As a model, he proposed something similar to a current Chinese campaign against eating shark-fin soup.
2_33	0.098875449	In it, he said, a popular basketball player asks ``What's wrong with us that we kill the sharks for the fin?"
2_34	0.097408567	While the 1989 ban forbids all unapproved sales of ivory between nations, illegal material that slips through can become legal once it turns up in a new country.
2_35	0.098865318	Before the 1989 ban, most smuggled ivory was shipped to Europe, the United States and Japan.
2_36	0.099353554	Now, the report found, most of it is going to China and Japan, although authorities say some is turning up again in the United States.
3_0	0.23173586	The UN agency regulating the trade in endangered species, CITES, on Wednesday urged African states to overcome their deepening divide over a ban on the ivory trade and elephant conservation.
3_1	0.037771993	"We need an African position on this issue," said David Morgan, the head of CITES' scientific support unit.
3_2	0.048181301	"As long as Africa is divided, then the chances of success are not so high," he told journalists.
3_3	0.094865733	The agency revealed that the mainly southern and eastern African nations in the elephants' range, as well as Mali, submitted conflicting proposals for the its triennial conference starting on June 3.
3_4	0.069824166	They range from Tanzania's request to downgrade controls locally, to Kenya and Mali's joint proposal to maintain a complete ban on ivory trade for 20 years.
3_5	0.13727153	"This demonstrates the divisions that still exist between African nations on the way forward for conservation of African elephants.
3_6	0.05166214	That gap is certainly something we in the secretariat feel needs to be bridged," Morgan said.
3_7	0.076590846	"We're hoping to organise a dialogue meeting for all the countries that hold African elephants before the conference, so that away from the spotlight they can find some sort of agreement," he added.
3_8	0.094073917	The conference allows countries to amend rules aimed at defining and protecting endangered animal and plant species, including the 1989 ban on commercial ivory trade and some conditional, one-off sales allowed since then.
3_9	0.11245858	Kenya and Mali have proposed a complete ban on the overall trade in elephant tusks or finished ivory products for two decades for consideration at the conference in The Hague, CITES said.
3_10	0.13346918	The West and East African nations argued that allowing any trade in ivory would increase elephant poaching.
3_11	0.0935925	Meanwhile, Tanzania is recommending that its domestic elephant population be downgraded from the blanket protection afforded under a complete trade ban (CITES Appendix I), to more limited restrictions (Appendix II).
3_12	0.09580564	Although it did not propose any immediate quota, Tanzania said some ivory trading would provide a "sustainable and valuable instrument of conservation," according to the UN agency.
3_13	0.096407207	Botswana and Namibia have submitted a joint proposal to maintain restricted sales in southern Africa while easing conditions for future sales.
3_14	0.098223359	Botswana is also independently seeking authorisation for additional one-off ivory sales of 40 tonnes.
3_15	0.097073322	The conference on June 3 to 15 is also due to re-examine a monitoring system to assess the impact of poaching, which Botswana, Namibia and South Africa were meant set up in return for being allowed one-off sales totalling 60 tonnes of ivory.

4_2	0.076321618	"The government will never give a blank check to culling," Marthinus van Schalkwyk said, but stressed it had to take a more hands-on approach to controlling its elephants in order to preserve the delicate balance of nature in the flagship Kruger National Park and other wildlife reserves.
4_3	0.16467793	"We have about 20,000 elephants in South Africa, more or less 14,000 in the Kruger National Park.

4_7	0.074265055	Although the population explosion is good news for the tourists who flock to the parks in the hope of spotting the Big Five -- elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, buffalo -- it is inflicting a heavy toll on vegetation and other animal species.

7_7	0.074995229	The DNA technique, developed by Wasser.
7_8	0.052614965	analyzes the slight variations in specific genes among elephants from different regions and different habits (savanna vs. forest).
7_9	0.068753698	The technique had been applied to ivory from individual elephants, but the new work uses statistical methods to apply it across a group.
7_10	0.08240587	(The researchers sampled ivory from 37 tusks in the shipment; the hankos are still being analyzed.)
7_11	0.083908851	The tusk analysis allowed investigators to focus on one part of Africa rather than the whole continent, and prompted changes in the way Zambia deals with poachers.
7_12	0.079464521	But, the researchers say not much progress has been made in the case, and there is more ivory smuggling now than at any time since the ban started.
7_13	0.066515323	In addition to work like theirs, they say, more outside aid needs to be provided for enforcement efforts in Zambia and elsewhere.
7_14	0.09223923	THE GOOD, THE BAD IN CIRCUIT BOARD
7_15	0.072998985	Recycling electronic devices isn't easy, and recycling the heart of a computer or other device -- the printed circuit board -- is among the most difficult tasks of all.
7_16	0.087345658	The problem with circuit boards is that they are a complex sandwich of materials, mostly glass-reinforced resins and metals.
7_17	0.084696629	Because there are billions of circuit boards around and because some of the materials are valuable (including metals like copper and gold) and some toxic (including heavy metals and flame retardants), it can pay to keep them out of landfills or incinerators.
7_18	0.088571653	But methods of separating circuit board materials often involve heat or chemicals or both, and that can create additional environmental problems.
7_19	0.091263359	Jia Li and colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have developed and tested an environmentally friendly recycling method that uses technology similar to what might be found in a laser printer.
7_20	0.093686244	The technique is described in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.
7_21	0.094879034	First, components like switches and capacitors (which can contain toxic metals) are stripped from the boards.
7_22	0.097527465	Then the boards are crushed, effectively breaking them down into metallic and nonmetallic particles.
7_23	0.098786347	These are separated using an electrostatic method, essentially the same technique that spreads toner across a rotating drum in a laser printer to produce a page.
7_24	0.098342544	The separation process uses a metal drum, too, that the mixed particles fall onto.
7_25	0.10101762	The nonmetallic particles pick up a static charge, while a stronger charge is induced in the metallic particles.
7_26	0.098757185	Both stick to the drum, but the metallic particles are immediately discharged to an electrode.
7_27	0.10186954	Without a charge, they fall off the drum into a hopper.
7_28	0.098653329	The nonmetallic particles remain on the drum as it rotates, eventually being scraped off so that they fall into another hopper.
7_29	0.10074689	The metals can then be separated using conventional techniques, while the researchers experimented with turning the resinous particles into a kind of nonmetallic plate that they suggest could be used as insulating boards or other building materials.
8_0	0.11598545	Thieves in northeast Cambodia poisoned a domesticated elephant before sawing off its valuable tusks to sell on the black market, police said Tuesday.
8_1	0.042851978	The 62-year-old bull elephant was found dead Saturday some 100 metres (yards) from its owner's home in Ratanakkiri province, police said, adding that it appeared to have been fed jack fruit laced with rat poison.
8_2	0.06283195	"The elephant's tusks, measuring between 70 to 80 centimeters (about 32 inches) long each, were sawed off," said deputy provincial police chief Hor Ang.
8_3	0.12230964	He said the tusks could fetch thousands of dollars on the illegal ivory market.
8_4	0.094528024	No one had been arrested for the killing, Hor Ang said, adding the elephant's body had since been butchered for meat.
8_5	0.09697969	Only 30 elephants remain in Ratanakkiri, where the animals are a key means of transport for villagers.

9_1	0.079949643	The complex science of DNA analysis is now helping protect elephants by showing police and conservationists the source of black-market ivory.
9_2	0.1006153	The price of ivory has nearly quadrupled in recent years, prompting poachers to kill more elephants to sell their tusks illegally.
9_3	0.096362478	Protecting the giant beasts is complicated by the fact they spread across large parts of Africa and authorities are unsure where the illegal hunting is occurring.
9_4	0.14493587	But the seizure of more than six tons of ivory in Singapore in 2002 has helped solve part of that puzzle, according to a report by Samuel K. Wasser of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington in this week's online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
9_5	0.075823759	Wasser and colleagues took samples of the confiscated ivory and compared it with baseline DNA collected from elephants across the continent over several years.
9_6	0.077578587	DNA is the internal blueprint for life that carries the genes that develop into each individual.
9_7	0.10763733	The comparison showed that the tusks seized from the black market came from elephants on Africa's broad savannas, primarily from a small area of southern Africa, most likely centered on Zambia, the researchers said.
9_8	0.094347901	Authorities had suspected the confiscated ivory had multiple origins, the researchers said, but "our results caused law enforcement to substantially narrow the area of origin and the trade routes being investigated."
9_9	0.11289517	The research was funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, African Elephant Conservation Fund, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Center for Conservation Biology.
