0_0	0.30135621	The rocket strike against the US embassy in Athens has revived fears of extreme- left violence, never completely eradicated despite the break-up of Greece's main radical groups earlier this decade.
0_1	0.22249106	In the run-up to the Athens 2004 Olympics, the Greek police succeeded in dismantling the country's two deadliest groups -- November 17 and the People's Revolutionary Struggle (ELA) -- which had combined for a quarter-century of assassinations and attacks on police, banks and foreign interest targets.
0_2	0.13006857	Arson attacks against "imperialist" and "capitalist" targets continued from a variety of small groups, but in 2003 a new outfit emerged with the know-how to carry out more destructive strikes: Revolutionary Struggle (EA).
0_3	0.31084718	On Friday, the Greek authorities said they were investigating a claim that the rocket attack was also carried out by this extreme left-wing group.
0_4	0.14159194	"It is probably domestic activity... as is seen from the apparent assumption of responsibility by Revolutionary Struggle," said Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras, adding that the attack constituted "an attempt to revive terrorist (activity)" which would fail.
0_5	0.11436135	The previously unknown group drew blood with its first attack in 2003, injuring a police officer in two explosions at the Athens court complex where members of November 17 were on trial at the time.
0_6	0.08596325	The new group's most brazen coup came in May 2004, when three homemade bombs exploded outside an Athens district police station at a time of high security for the Athens Games, an attack timed to coincide with the 100-day countdown to the Olympics.
0_7	0.11272615	Revolutionary Struggle last struck in May 2005, when it placed an explosive device near the home of former public order minister George Voulgarakis to protest his role in "the Greek state's involvement in the (US) war on terror."
0_8	0.16312151	Polydoras added that the Friday rocket attack -- which was apparently aimed at the embassy's eagle emblem -- was a "symbolic" gesture.
