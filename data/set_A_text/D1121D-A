3_3	0.32993511	Tony Taylor, who along with Vick pleaded not guilty to the charges just four days ago, has promised to cooperate with federal prosecutors and share "detailed facts" for their case against Vick and two other co-defendants, Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips.

3_8	0.087947886	Prosecutors could recommend a lighter sentence for Taylor depending on how cooperative he is, legal experts said, and that is why the court set Taylor's sentencing for a date after the trial.
3_9	0.084742701	"(Taylor) has all these incentives to cooperate fully with the government in order to reduce his possible exposure to a sentence and a fine," said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who specializes in Constitutional law and the federal courts.

3_16	0.17938612	A federal grand jury indicted Taylor, Vick and the two others this month on a single count of conspiring to violate three laws: the interstate travel act by crossing state lines to engage in illegal gambling; sponsoring a dog in an animal fighting venture; and buying, transporting and receiving dogs for animal fighting.
3_17	0.32448652	Taylor pleaded guilty Monday to conspiring to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture.
3_18	0.12372041	Here are some of the key facts Taylor agreed to in his plea deal when he signed a statement of facts with federal prosecutors:
3_19	0.24705878	Taylor, Vick, Peace and Phillips set up a business called "Bad Newz Kennels" in rural Surry County, Va. to raise and train pit bulls for dogfights;
3_20	0.16182946	The men gambled on the fights in Virginia and several other states.
3_21	0.14452732	Vick, an ex-Virginia Tech football star who now has a $130 million contract with the Falcons, sponsored dogs in fights with purses as low as $3,000;
3_22	0.072396563	Vick almost exclusively funded the dog-fighting operation and gambling monies.
3_23	0.075524497	And the proceeds from the gambling wins were split by Taylor, Phillips and Peace;
3_24	0.11310166	At various times, Taylor, Peace and Phillips executed dogs they didn't think would fight well by shooting them.
3_25	0.11228506	Taylor electrocuted one dog in 2002.
3_26	0.13446214	At Vick and Taylor's arraignment Thursday, prosecutors announced they would be seeking a "superceding" indictment before the end of August, meaning they could identify additional charges or defendants in the case.
3_27	0.089038285	Taylor's plea hearing showed up on Hudson's schedule the following day.
3_28	0.077128418	"There certainly looks like there might be some linkage," said Tobias, the University of Richmond law professor.
3_29	0.08097261	"He may have been afraid of what might be in that superceding indictment."
3_30	0.13440663	Taylor played a key role in the dog fighting operation in May of 2001, federal prosecutors say, by identifying the Surry County property as a suitable location for housing and training the dogs.
3_31	0.097706742	Vick bought the property the following month.
3_32	0.092497996	In June of 2002, Taylor signed the articles of incorporation as the organizer for a business based at that Surry County property called MV7 LLC.

3_34	0.10186748	And between 2003 and 2006, Surry County issued three pet licenses in Taylor's name to house between 30 and 50 dogs on Vick's property.
3_35	0.099007458	Peace's name also is on one of the licenses.
3_36	0.10807602	Taylor confirmed in the statement of facts he signed with federal prosecutors that he used a large portion of his gambling winnings from the dogfights for living expenses because he devoted his time to caring for and training the pit bulls.
3_37	0.094851565	The document says Taylor left the business after a disagreement with Phillips and others in September of 2004.
3_38	0.093263	Taylor has had other run-ins with the law.
3_39	0.10316042	In 1992, he received a two-year sentence in the Bronx on a drug-trafficking charge.
3_40	0.096393378	He served seven months in a New York state prison before being released on parole on Feb. 18, 1993.

3_48	0.098170762	Also last week, Nike suspended Vick's endorsement contract without pay and Reebok halted sales of jerseys bearing his name.
3_49	0.097281759	In another development Monday, a group that organized a rally in support of Vick last weekend called for a national boycott of Nike, Reebok and any other corporate sponsors that have severed ties with Vick.

4_5	0.32875476	Taylor outlined his involvement with the others in a dogfighting enterprise known as "Bad Newz Kennels," according to the statement.
4_6	0.1039483	He attested to how he scouted a property for Vick to buy in Smithfield, Va., as the base for the venture and cited numerous examples in which the group bought, trained and sponsored dogs in connection with fighting.
4_7	0.10186992	He also said they gambled on the fights.
4_8	0.12720234	Although the statement said several dogs were killed, it did not say that Vick killed any of them.

5_7	0.093428893	Taylor's promise to provide testimony did not include fingering Vick as one who killed dogs considered poor fighters, their gruesome manners of demise outlined in an indictment that shocked US sports fans last week.
5_8	0.12083591	Atlanta Falcons playmaker Vick, a quarterback with unusual rushing talents, signed a 130 million-dollar contract three years ago and according to Taylor was the major financier of Bad Newz Kennels as well as wagers on fighting dogs.
5_9	0.1136939	Taylor's details, according to reports in the Atlanta Journal- Constitution and Daily Press of Virginia, outline eight fights Vick either sponsored or attended or both, three of them across state lines to violate federal laws.
5_10	0.1202885	The document says the dogfight plan began in 2001, with property for housing and training dogs bought weeks after Vick was the first player selected in the NFL Draft.

7_1	0.54638266	One of the men facing federal dogfighting charges along with Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick is apparently discussing a plea deal with federal prosecutors.
7_2	0.26152952	Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Va., has a plea-agreement hearing scheduled for 9 a.m.
7_3	0.24849471	Monday in the U.S. District Court in Richmond, Va., before Judge Henry E. Hudson.
7_4	0.11962702	Meanwhile, court records show a sealed order signed by Hudson was issued in the case Friday.
7_5	0.28631205	The plea hearing could mean that Taylor, who pleaded not guilty to the charges Thursday, has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.
7_6	0.32044466	Vick and the two other co-defendants in his case also pleaded not guilty Thursday.
7_7	0.10434505	"This could be very bad news for Vick," said Steven D. Benjamin, a veteran criminal defense attorney from Richmond who has represented many clients before Hudson.
7_8	0.16162319	"If he is pleading guilty, he is cooperating with the government."
7_9	0.14807874	Taylor could get a lighter sentence through a plea deal.
7_10	0.10591499	"Whoever is the first in line gets the best deal," said Michael Morchower, a former federal prosecutor and now a Richmond-based criminal defense attorney who has also represented defendants before Hudson.
7_11	0.073066679	"That's the problem with co-defendants.
7_12	0.078866043	They are going to want to save themselves.
7_13	0.094958273	And the government wants cooperation.
7_14	0.057865458	And the person who cooperates first gets the biggest reward."
7_15	0.062390402	Taylor's attorney could not be reached for comment Friday night.
7_16	0.11620451	And a spokesman for Vick did not respond to a telephone call for comment.
7_17	0.14005887	At Taylor and Vick's arraignment Thursday, federal prosecutors announced they would seek a "superceding" indictment in the case before the end of August, which could mean additional charges and defendants.
7_18	0.14338329	A federal grand jury this month indicted Vick and Taylor and their two co-defendants - Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips - on a single count of conspiracy relating to dogfighting.
7_19	0.2067064	They face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted on the charge of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities.
7_20	0.16928706	If convicted of another alleged offense - conspiring to sponsor a dog in an animal- fighting venture - they could face up to one year in prison and $100,000 in fines.
7_21	0.25316138	The indictment says Vick and the others set up a business called "Bad Newz Kennels" to raise and train pit bulls for fighting.
7_22	0.15450202	They staged the fights, according to federal prosecutors, in Smithfield, Va., on property Vick bought in June 2001.
7_23	0.15605515	Prosecutors say Vick and his friends crossed state lines to participate in dogfights in several other states.
7_24	0.12340233	For their case, prosecutors are relying on four unnamed cooperating witnesses mentioned in the indictment.
7_25	0.10437564	Vick's name also is mentioned repeatedly in the document.
7_26	0.11417708	For example, the indictment says Vick, Peace and Phillips executed approximately eight dogs they determined not to be good fighters by hanging, drowning and slamming at least one dog's body to the ground.
7_27	0.16660778	The indictment also says Vick and the others bet on the dogfights.
7_28	0.094984696	And it details how Vick retrieved a book bag containing $23,000 in cash at one point to pay a winning opponent.
7_29	0.11374087	The case stems from a drug investigation involving Vick's cousin - Davon Boddie - on Vick's rural property in Surry County, Va.
7_30	0.099889035	Boddie listed the property as his address after being arrested on a drug charge in April.
7_31	0.10218264	After they investigated the property, authorities said they found kennels, treadmills, a "rape stand" used to restrain aggressive female dogs during breeding, and 54 pit bulls, some with scars and injuries officials said are consistent with dog fighting.
7_32	0.10059709	During an interview in April, Vick blamed family for the mistreated dogs but has declined comment since then.
7_33	0.099342618	But his attorney read a statement after the arraignment Thursday, proclaiming his innocence.
7_34	0.095687635	"Today you all either heard or saw Michael take the first step toward proving his innocence," his attorney Billy Martin said Thursday.
7_35	0.088789424	"We intend to prove Mike's innocence at trial.
7_36	0.088941672	We are conducting our own investigation.
7_37	0.099183606	And we look forward to the opportunity to being able to walk inside this courtroom and saying to the world that Michael Vick is innocent."

8_1	0.26085925	If you're a betting man, you're probably wondering what the over/under is on Michael Vick, the star quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.
8_2	0.068799288	I'd say his NFL career will be over in under a year.
8_3	0.39411066	See, the feds are charging Vick with holding pit bull dog fights on his property in rural Virginia.
8_4	0.031525348	Remember the good old days when football bad boys got busted for simple stuff like bouncing topless dancers on their laps?
8_5	0.071380129	Well, those halcyon Norman Rockwell days are gone.
8_6	0.21281458	The charges on Vick say dogs who were too scared to fight were tortured, shot, drowned, hanged or electrocuted.
8_7	0.10161438	So much for Vick getting a gig endorsing Purina Dog Chow.
8_8	0.083266456	I can think of a few things Vick could do other than torturing dogs that would make himself and the NFL look worse.
8_9	0.023895375	But I won't mention them here because I don't want to ruin your breakfast.
8_10	0.27374494	Meanwhile, the NFL has ordered Vick to stay away from the Falcons' training camp.
8_11	0.082936515	Who could blame them?
8_12	0.022742331	It's hard to work out when PETA is pelting your helmet with eggs.
8_13	0.11696084	Every time one of these dog-fighting stories pops up, people blame the pit bulls.
8_14	0.08202535	I lived next to a pit bull for about 10 years, and she was a sweet old thing.
8_15	0.16687073	See, the trouble with pit bulls isn't the pit bulls.
8_16	0.082762563	It's the entourage they attract.
8_17	0.11471535	Pit bulls are goober magnets.
8_18	0.092347936	As trailer homes are to tornadoes, so are pit bulls to rednecks.
8_19	0.067402749	Bring home a couple of pit bulls, and soon someone will be cooking a whole hog in your front yard.
8_20	0.086631154	And the banjo music will commence.
8_21	0.10081837	To stop the dog fighting, maybe the NFL should establish a weight ceiling on dog ownership that tops out at, say, Pomeranian.
8_22	0.12754334	Early in the investigation, Vick claimed innocence by saying he didn't know what was going on on his property.
8_23	0.092061605	That's a little tough to swallow, isn't it?
8_24	0.097350106	The grounds have dog pens all over the place, and the buildings on the property are painted black.
8_25	0.093712286	He didn't notice the black paint?
8_26	0.07436772	Did he think there was a teen goth convention going on back there?
8_27	0.099479749	You know, I've never really figured out why anybody would want to go to a dog fight.
8_28	0.096975839	OK, so I do sort of understand the appeal.
8_29	0.088217572	It's a macho thing taken part in by guys who are living their lives vicariously through critters who get to spend the day scratching themselves in public and eating off the floor.
8_30	0.097200548	So they're jealous.
8_31	0.10009707	But the fact that dog fights exist proves people will bet on just about anything.
8_32	0.091870836	Which makes you wonder: What was the first bet ever made?
8_33	0.092278335	I can think of several possibilities:
8_34	0.093341747	How long do you suppose she's going to put up with his garbage?
8_35	0.087155356	--?
8_36	0.09764433	Do you think he's really going to eat that oyster?
8_37	0.087275186	--?
8_38	0.094412847	Is you is, or is you ain't, my baby?
8_39	0.1033602	Do you think he can really get that sofa through the front door of that cave?
8_40	0.098046249	Do you think that thing is really going to roll?
8_41	0.088344077	I'll take the woolly mammoth and the points.
8_42	0.098112388	If we throw it in the water, do you think it'll sink?
8_43	0.10288214	But I doubt if the first bet ever was placed on a dog fight.
8_44	0.10020555	Although I'll betcha Michael Vick is going to do some time.

9_1	0.16327005	Michael Vick was due in federal court Thursday to start a legal process that jeopardizes not only his career, but also his freedom.
9_2	0.3109183	The Atlanta Falcons quarterback was expected to appear at a bond hearing and enter a plea on dogfighting conspiracy charges.
9_3	0.32477384	Vick is accused with three others of conspiracy involving competitive dogfighting, procuring and training pit bulls for fighting, and conducting the enterprise across state lines.
9_4	0.36432694	Federal prosecutors allege the operation -- known as Bad Newz Kennels -- operated on Vick's property in rural Surry County.
9_5	0.22005148	They all face up to six years in prison, $350,000 in fines and restitution if convicted of both charges.
9_6	0.28831721	The grisly allegations detailed in an 18-page indictment sparked protests by animal rights groups at the headquarters of the NFL and the Falcons, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has barred Vick from training camp while the league investigates.
9_7	0.15382092	Falcons owner Arthur Blank said the team wanted to suspend Vick for four games, the maximum penalty a team can assess a player, but the NFL asked him to wait.
9_8	0.11479265	Instead, Blank has told his embattled player to focus on his legal problems, not football.
9_9	0.15854633	The case began April 25 when investigators conducting a drug search at the home found 66 dogs, including 55 pit bulls, and equipment typically used in dogfighting.
9_10	0.14917718	Items such as a "rape stand" that holds aggressive dogs in place for mating and a "breakstick" used to pry open a dog's mouth in a fight were seized.
9_11	0.14812386	Vick contended he knew nothing about a dogfighting operation at the home, where one of his cousins lived, and said he rarely visited.
9_12	0.10717812	He has since declined comment, citing his attorney's advice.
9_13	0.13041839	Attorney Lawrence Woodward of Virginia Beach, who has also represented Allen Iverson and Vick's younger brother, Marcus, has not returned several phone messages.
9_14	0.10752943	Animal rights organizations have seized on the case as an opportunity to raise awareness of the largely underground and always gruesome world of dogfighting, where dogs are trained to fight to the death.
9_15	0.10528332	Five hours before Vick's scheduled arraignment, animal rights activists, supporters of the athlete and the media gathered early Thursday outside the federal courthouse.
9_16	0.088717764	About 40 people began queuing for a seat in the courtroom or an overflow courtroom.
9_17	0.10250317	Some members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals dressed in dog costumes and carried signs, including one with the image of a battered pit bull and the words "Dogfighting Victim."
9_18	0.097267074	A trio of supporters from Boston wearing Vick's No. 7 jersey and Atlanta Falcons' hats made the nine-hour trip south to support Vick.
9_19	0.14061594	According to the indictment filed July 17, dogs not killed in the fighting pit were often shot, hanged, drowned or, in one case, slammed to the ground.
9_20	0.12952146	The document alleges that Vick was consulted before one losing dog was wet down and electrocuted.
9_21	0.10668364	It alleges that the dogfighting operation began in 2001, not long after Vick parlayed a dazzling two-year run as the quarterback at Virginia Tech into the first overall selection in the NFL Draft.
9_22	0.093998085	His first contract was for $62 million.
9_23	0.099746345	In 2004, he signed a 10-year, $130 million deal, then the richest in league history.
9_24	0.11939992	The indictment alleges the fights offered purses as high as $26,000, and Vick once paid $23,000 to the owner of two pit bulls that had beaten Bad Newz Kennels dogs.
