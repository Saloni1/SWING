0_1	0.045633609	Worsening stone desertification is threatening the survival of about 450,000 farmers in southwest China's Guizhou Province, and they are in dire need of being relocated, local authorities have said.
0_2	0.048306043	Desertification occurs when arable or habitable land is transformed into desert.
0_3	0.054459728	Guizhou is affected by a form of desertification called stone desertification in which soil is eroded, water levels drop, the land begins to become barren and underlying stones are exposed.
0_4	0.069536216	Guizhou is the Chinese province suffers most from stone desertification.
0_5	0.097331834	About one fifth of the province's land area -- 35,920 square kilometers -- is afflicted by karst rocky desertification, according to the Guizhou Provincial Department of Water Resources.
0_6	0.092101067	As the soil erodes, survival for local farmers becomes increasingly precarious.
0_7	0.089540456	About 450,000 local residents are facing a drastic deterioration of their living conditions, said officials from the department.
0_8	0.094983064	But he did not provide further details of any relocation plan.
0_9	0.10018887	Soil erosion affects up to 73,200 square kilometers of the land Guizhou -- 41 percent of its total land area -- but around 25,000 square kilometers have been brought under control along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Pearl River in the past few years, he said.
0_10	0.096715151	At the current rate at which damaged areas are being recovered -- 1,000 square kilometers per year -- Guizhou would need at least 70 years to bring soil erosion under control, he added.

1_1	0.05282104	Half a century after Mao Zedong's "Great Leap Forward" brought irrigation to the arid grasslands in this remote corner of northwest China, the government is giving up on its attempt to make a breadbasket out of what has increasingly become a stretch of scrub and sand dunes.
1_2	0.048587909	In a problem that is pervasive in much of China, over-farming has drawn down the water table so low that desert is overtaking farmland.
1_3	0.051059598	Authorities have ordered farmers here in Gansu province to vacate their properties over the next 3 1/2 years, and will replace 20 villages with newly planted grass in a final effort to halt the advance of the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts.
1_4	0.025109185	"I don't want to move," said Chen Ying, 58, sitting in a sparsely furnished bedroom dominated by a red, wall-sized poster of Mao, the communist founding father who sought to catapult Chinese farming and industry into modernity with the so-called Great Leap Forward.
1_5	0.01129772	"But if we keep using the groundwater, it will decline," said Chen.
1_6	0.075197253	"We have to think about the next generation."
1_7	0.015374055	It is not just Chen's home region that is at risk.
1_8	0.054809119	The relocation program is part of a larger plan to rein in China's expanding deserts, which now cover one-third of the country and continue to grow because of overgrazing, deforestation, urban sprawl and droughts.
1_9	0.036776356	The shifting sands have swallowed thousands of Chinese villages along the fabled Silk Road and sparked a sharp increase in sandstorms; dust from China clouds the skies of South Korea and has been linked to respiratory problems in California.
1_10	0.091631031	Since 2001, China has spent nearly US$9 billion (euro6.8 billion) planting billions of trees, converting marginal farmland to forest and grasslands and enforcing logging and grazing bans.
1_11	0.031872014	The policy is driven in part by concerns over food, as farmland yields not only to the deserts but also to pollution and economic development.
1_12	0.13183532	China has less than 7 percent of the world's arable land with which to feed 1.3 billion people -- more than 20 percent of the world's population.
1_13	0.1226531	By comparison, the United States has 20 percent of the world's arable land to feed 5 percent of the population.
1_14	0.049156635	But the initiative is also a tacit admission by the government that the effort to feed the country at all costs may have backfired.
1_15	0.049460304	Chen was just a child when the government turned the rugged grasslands on the edge of the Tengger into an oasis.
1_16	0.042484709	In the 1950s, as part of Mao's scheme to boost food production, the government built the Hongyashan Reservoir in Gansu province with the goal of irrigating nearly 1 million acres (400,000 hectares).
1_17	0.040058516	But over the past two decades, new reservoirs were built farther up the Shiyang River, sapping the Hongyashan Reservoir.
1_18	0.032646281	It even dried up in 2004 and is only about half full today.
1_19	0.060793781	Farmers responded by digging thousands of wells, causing the water table to drop hundreds of feet and the soil to become contaminated with salt.
1_20	0.048681619	Worried the desert could reach the city of Minqin, 35 miles (56 kilometers) away, authorities decided to return the land to its natural state.
1_21	0.06158041	"If the government does nothing, it is scared that the entire area will become a desert," said Sun Qing-Wei, a desertification expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
1_22	0.060776228	"There are alternative solutions like introducing new plant species or conserving water.
1_23	0.085148495	But this is the quickest solution.
1_24	0.072769343	The government can show the people they are doing something."
1_25	0.05947159	Chen, a grizzled farmer who sports a Mao cap, blue coat and baggy, mud-spattered pants, has planted dozens of trees outside his home to prevent the desert dunes from overrunning his property.
1_26	0.059393674	He also switched from wheat to less thirsty cotton and fennel.
1_27	0.063850934	But he appears to have met his match in the government, which already banned the use of well water for irrigation and threatened to cut the electricity ahead of the scheduled move of his village later this year to a new location about 12 miles (19 kilometers) away.
1_28	0.06521599	Talk of the impending moves dominates the conversations of villagers, gathered around their coal-fired stoves to ward off the springtime chill.
1_29	0.089621435	Most are reluctant to leave.
1_30	0.072967298	Authorities are offering up to US$784 (euro589) per family to move 10,500 residents from Gansu Province, but the villagers don't trust the government to compensate them fairly.
1_31	0.077301045	Their ancestors are buried on their land, and their crops continue to earn a tidy income, they say -- even though the canals that once transported water to the area are bone-dry, and the wheat that thrived here is a distant memory.
1_32	0.076598585	"The government is taking this action against desertification, but we are the ones being forced to pay for this policy," said Li Jianzhu, a father of three in the village of Waixi, whose population has dropped nearly two-thirds to 60 residents.
1_33	0.078310032	Throughout the province, treeless, wind-swept plains stretch for miles (kilometers) in all directions.
1_34	0.082614414	Gone are the knee-high grasses and the Qingtu Lake, replaced by sands from the expanding Tengger and nearby Badain Jaran deserts and with soil scarred white from salt.

1_38	0.088543653	The battle against deserts is playing out across much of western China.
1_39	0.092122411	Desertification has caused as much as US$7 billion (euro5.3 billion) in annual economic losses, the China Daily reported.
1_40	0.092897036	Over the past decade, Chinese deserts expanded at a rate of 950 square miles (2,460 square kilometers) a year, according to Wang Tao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Lanzhou.
1_41	0.092722267	"There are quite a few countries with this problem but none on the scale of China because it is so big," said Lester Brown, president of Earth Policy Institute.
1_42	0.093741403	"You only have to go to northwest China and see that the numbers and size of dust storms are increasing."
1_43	0.094214808	Expanding deserts have contributed to a nearly six-fold increase in sandstorms in the past 50 years to two dozen annually, Wang said.
1_44	0.093893621	Global warming will worsen the problem, as rising temperatures lead to widespread drought and melt most glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau, depriving lakes and rivers of a crucial water source, according to the U.N.-funded Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
1_45	0.098428732	Hotter, drier land is more vulnerable to soil erosion, Wang said.
1_46	0.095839845	"This is the same problem the United States faced in the 1930s with the dust bowl."
1_47	0.096060787	Global warming also threatens to make a huge dent in grain production, which Brown said has already slipped from 432 million tons in 1998 to 422 million tons in 2006 because of desertification.
1_48	0.097324327	At the same time, grain consumption has risen about 4.4 million tons a year to 418 million tons, in part because of rising demand for beef, chicken and pork.
1_49	0.098434472	The production declines have forced China to draw down its grain stocks, and eventually it will need to buy a massive 30-50 million tons a year on the world market, Brown said.
1_50	0.097547937	"It's not that they are likely to face famine in the next few years.
1_51	0.10040943	But what they may face is rising food prices, and that can create political instability," he said.

2_1	0.044558125	China is forcing nomadic Tibetan herders to settle in towns to clear land for development, leaving many unable to earn a living, a human rights group said in a report issued Sunday.
2_2	0.034221771	Herders have been forced to slaughter herds of yaks, sheep and goats and Communist officials have paid minimal compensation and failed to protect Tibetans' legal rights, Human Rights Watch said.
2_3	0.04390989	It said tens of thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands, of people have been affected.
2_4	0.032619685	The group appealed to Beijing to suspend the resettlements until a review system is put in place and to allow Tibetans to return to their land if they were forcibly moved or received no compensation.
2_5	0.054505781	"They are destroying our Tibetan (herder) communities by not letting us live in our area and thus wiping out our livelihood completely," one Tibetan, identified only by the initials F.R., was quoted as saying.
2_6	0.066448284	Human Rights Watch said the resettlements in Tibet and in adjacent ethnic Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai provinces are linked to Beijing's effort, launched in 1999, to develop China's poor, restive west and bind it to the bustling east.
2_7	0.075136018	China's foreign ministry and the local governments of Tibet and the provinces cited did not respond to requests by phone and fax for comment.
2_8	0.071700188	The resettlements began in 2000 and have taken place more intensively since 2003, Human Rights Watch said.
2_9	0.083510691	"Many Tibetan herders have been required to slaughter most of their livestock and move into newly built housing colonies in or near towns, abandoning their traditional way of life," the report said.
2_10	0.089408964	"Many Tibetan agricultural communities have had their land confiscated, with minimal compensation, or have been evicted to make way for mining, infrastructure projects or urban development," the report said.
2_11	0.093451484	The most extreme efforts were in Sichuan's Golok region, where authorities banned grazing in 2003 and required herders to sell their herds and move into newly built townships, Human Rights Watch said, citing interviews with Tibetans who were affected.
2_12	0.10005338	It quoted one as saying: "Even if we become town dwellers and try to do business, we don't have the education or the experience to succeed.
2_13	0.089426348	We don't even know how to live from farming.
2_14	0.09045837	So in future we will face great difficulty."
2_15	0.098666961	Chinese authorities explained the changes as a response to overgrazing by Tibetan herds that was causing erosion and soil loss, Human Rights Watch said.
