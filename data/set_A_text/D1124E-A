0_1	0.035160022	"The ash rain fell on Saturday and Sunday but luckily we also have had heavy rains, so the ash was quickly cleaned from the surface," said Edi Susanto, an official from the Lumajang district spokesman's office.

2_0	0.28065275	A mud volcano that has erupted in Indonesia, forcing the evacuation of thousands of villagers, was most probably caused by drilling for gas, according to the first published scientific study into the phenomenon.
2_1	0.082012426	The eruption "appears to have been triggered by drilling of overpressured porous and permeable limestones at depth of around 2,830 metres (7,735 feet) below the surface," says the study, conducted by British experts and published in a US journal.
2_2	0.097638533	It adds that the volcano has been disgorging between 7,000 and 150,000 cubic metres (245,000 and 5.25 million cubic feet) of mud every day.
2_3	0.072212951	Such pressures, coupled to the local geology, suggest the flow "will continue for many months and possibly years to come," it warns.
2_4	0.032766786	In the coming months, sag-like subsidence several kilometers (miles) wide will occur, and around the main vent there is likely to be "more dramatic collapse," forming a crater, it adds.
2_5	0.037644977	An area of at least 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles) around the volcano will be uninhabitable for years, and over 11,000 people will be permanently displaced, it says.

2_13	0.081563579	"It is standard industry procedure that this kind of drilling requires the use of steel casing to support the borehole, to protect against the pressure of fluids such as water, oil or gas," Davies said in a press release.
2_14	0.087590663	"In the case of Lusi, a pressured limestone rock containing water -- a water aquifer -- was drilled while the lower part of the borehole was exposed and not protected by casing.
2_15	0.092245516	"As a result, rocks fractured and a mix of mud and water worked its way to the surface.
2_16	0.099743577	Our research brings us to the conclusion that the incident was most probably the result of drilling."
2_17	0.095382507	Davies said the case in Indonesia was similar to a blowout that happened offshore of Brunei in 1979.
2_18	0.095501729	"Just as is most probably the case with Lusi, the Brunei event was caused by drilling and it took an international oil company almost 30 years and 20 relief wells and monitoring before the eruption stopped," he added.
2_19	0.17135502	Last week, Indonesia's coordinating minister for social welfare, Aburizal Bakrie, whose family firm controls Lapindo Brantas, said the volcano was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities.
2_20	0.10120534	"It is not because of the Lapindo drill case but it is because of the quake," he said, referring to a May 27 temblor near the ancient city of Yogyakarta that killed around 6,000 people.
2_21	0.090271781	But this scenario is ruled out by the study.
2_22	0.09886056	It concludes that the quake was not to blame, mainly because two days elapsed before mud volcano erupted, and no other mud volcanoes occurred in the region after the temblor.
