0_0	0.4090909090909091	Lots of people here remember well how racked with fear they were in the weeks and days leading up to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the volcano that rained utter havoc from 30 miles away on this tiny town.
0_1	0.18181818181818182	But 24 years later, as scientists warn of a new, imminent eruption, the fear has not returned.
0_2	0.0	For one, scientists do not believe the eruption will be nearly as powerful.
0_3	0.034482758620689655	But also, residents now know the drill, the evacuation routes and the ways to protect themselves and their property from heavy ash fall.Residents are slightly nervous but mostly aggravated at all the local traffic, caused by the thousands of tourists, reporters and entrepreneurs headed through town over the last few days on their way to a lookout point on the mountain.
0_4	0.5384615384615384	In 1980, once scientists knew that powerful earthquakes were stirring Mount St. Helens, few people were visiting the mountain.
0_5	0.0	Now, a spot at the Castle Lake Lookout parking lot is a rare commodity.
0_6	0.11764705882352941	And far from running away, people like Denise Horton, who lives 130 miles away in Sandy, Ore., are traveling hours to get here, bursting with anticipation for the eruption.
0_7	0.05555555555555555	"It's like waiting for a parade that's late," said Horton, who opened a hot dog stand on the mountain, selling mostly to reporters who were among the dozens camped out at the lookout point.

0_9	0.04	The fact that they are here is testament to the vast forecasting gains of scientists, who are armed with new technology and skills honed from the 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people, obliterated 200 houses and spawned worldwide interest in the study of volcanoes.

0_14	0.0	But for all their high-tech gadgetry, scientists still do not have a direct way to answer the questions they most want to answer: Where is the molten rock beneath the volcano?
0_15	0.0	And where is it going?
0_16	0.0	"We don't know where it is," said William Steele, a seismologist at the University of Washington.
0_17	0.0	The expectation is that magma -- underground molten rock -- will reach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more eruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger.
0_18	0.0	"Something could happen at any time, basically," Scott said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon.
0_19	0.0	Or, he said, "It may stall out and we may never see it."
0_20	0.0	That would disappoint Kathy Teas, who was living nearby in 1980 and was evacuated from her home.
0_21	0.0	Teas later moved to Oregon, but on Sunday she was back, having spent the previous night at a campsite on the mountain, eager to see an eruption.

0_31	0.15384615384615385	Thus, when a new event occurs, like the continuous, 50-minute, low-frequency tremor on Saturday, the scientists sometimes need to quickly revise their thoughts.
0_32	0.1111111111111111	The swarms of earthquakes, a few a minute, have been interpreted as the breaking of rocks by the buildup of pressure.
0_33	0.0	The tremor -- accompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes -- suggested that the magma had broken through and was rising smoothlyleading scientists to suspect an eruption might be imminent.
0_34	0.0	After the tremor ended, the earthquakes resumed.
0_35	0.36363636363636365	At 3 a.m. Sunday, a second tremor occurred, this time lasting 25 minutes.
0_36	0.4	Again, the seismic activity died down, then picked up.
0_37	0.0	Through the day on Sunday, the intensity of the earthquakes diminished somewhat.
0_38	0.0	"The larger earthquakes have dropped off," Qamar said.
0_39	0.0	That could mean the pressure had lessened, and the volcano was quieting down.
0_40	0.0	Or it could mean that the magma had broken through the rock blockage and was now pushing its way toward the surface.
0_41	0.0	Or it could just be a lull.
0_42	0.0	"We're not interpreting much about that decrease," Scott said.
0_43	0.0	What has been unusual about the current episode is that all of the earthquakes have been shallow, within half a mile or so of the surface.
0_44	0.0	That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is rising from the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors and eruptions is left over from six years ago.
0_45	0.0	Then, as now, a swarm of earthquakes shook the area, and scientists believe that magma rose upward beneath the crater, although nothing broke through as an eruption.
0_46	0.0	Whether the magma is new or old is important, because that could determine whether the eruptions will explosively shoot clouds of ash that spread over a large area or, less catastrophically, just push out lava.
0_47	0.0	"The analogy is the old Coke can that you shake up and open," Scott said.
0_48	0.0	"If you shake it a whole lot and pop it open, you're going to get a lot of frothing and it's going to be an explosive event.
0_49	0.0	But if you pour it in a glass and let the gas come out and then you try to shake the glass, you can't get as much fizz."
0_50	0.5384615384615384	Once scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be imminent, spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles from the crater.
0_51	0.2	But lookout points farther away were not considered to be in danger.
0_52	0.0	Here in Toutle (pronounced TOOT-el), a town of 700 that is the closest to the mountain, many residents said that while they were not panicking, they were concerned about an eruption causing a mudflow into the three nearby rivers, which were flooded and full of floating debris in 1980.

2_7	0.0	The pulsations of steam and dust on Friday, described by Major as "a relatively small burp," sent a gray-white plume nearly 10,000 feet into the air.
2_8	0.0	After the eruption, small earthquakes that had been rumbling around the volcano for the last week stopped, suggesting that pressures that had been building up had been relieved for now.
2_9	0.25	Seismic activity resumed later in the afternoon, Major said, but at a quieter level.
2_10	0.0	"This event is pretty much what we expected and anticipated over the last several days, a relatively small explosion from the lava dome," Major said.

2_13	0.2222222222222222	The instrument's readings showed that the site of the eruption was not particularly hot, indicating that the eruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several hundred feet underground.
2_14	0.0	The flow of water out of the crater increased slightly, Major said, but there was no danger of floods or mudslides.
2_15	0.0	Scientists said they saw no signs that would lead them to worry that a larger, dangerous eruption was imminent.
2_16	0.0	"There is no indication magma has worked its way up to the surface," Major said.
2_17	0.0	The belch on Friday might have instead been the denouement of some underground indigestion from six years ago.
2_18	0.0	Then, as in the last week, a swarm of small quakes rumbled around the dome, a bulge 925 feet high and a half-mile wide at the center of the crater, but then the ground quieted without a new eruption.
2_19	0.0	Analyzing the patterns of shaking, scientists said fresh magma, molten rock, had risen from deep below to the base of the dome, but had not broken through to the surface.

4_12	0.0	``This is exactly the kind of event we have been talking about and anticipating,'' Major said.
4_13	0.0	He noted there is no evidence that a major flow of gas-rich molten rock, which could trigger a sustained eruption, has ascended from its known location seven miles underground to the top of the mountain.
4_14	0.42857142857142855	Absent such a flow of molten rock, USGS scientists have said it is unlikely that recent increases in seismic activity on Mount St. Helens will result in a significant eruption that could endanger people or property outside the immediate vicinity.

8_4	0.5384615384615384	That suddenly created a more serious situation at Mount St. Helens, the most active volcano in the lower 48 states.
8_5	0.06666666666666667	But scientists said they did not expect an eruption on the magnitude of the May 1980 explosion that killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction.
8_6	0.5	Officials on Saturday evacuated an observatory five miles from the crater and warned that people with respiratory diseases could be affected if large amounts of ash became airborne.
8_7	0.38461538461538464	Hundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in recent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles below, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads from this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain.
8_8	0.0	The 2,100 residents of this town and others near the mountain, however, were not evacuated.
8_9	0.0	Officials, including Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who held a news conference Saturday afternoon in nearby Vancouver, Wash., said their houses were far enough away -- 30 miles to the west -- to be safe.
8_10	0.0	"This is red alert," Norton said, adding, "Overall, we are very fortunate that no one lives directly in the area that would be most impacted."
8_11	0.0	C. Daniel Miller, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said he expected an eruption "larger than what we saw on Friday, probably by quite a bit."
8_12	0.05555555555555555	The 50-minute tremor "is the kind of seismic signal that occurs not when rock is breaking, but when magma is actually moving up in the throat of the volcano," Miller said at a news conference Saturday evening.
8_13	0.0	"That's the sort of thing that frankly sends a chill up the back of a volcanologist," he said.
8_14	0.0	Scientists said Saturday that they saw more signs of deformation at the south side of the lava dome, a half-mile wide, 925-foot high bulge at the center of the volcano's crater.
8_15	0.0	The crew aboard a helicopter taking measurements on Saturday reported the smell of rotten eggs, probably hydrogen sulfide emanating from magma.
8_16	0.0	Until then, scientists had not detected significant amounts of volcanic gases.
8_17	0.0	Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively.
8_18	0.0	The greatest danger was expected to be potentially large ash plumes, which could shoot tens of thousands of feet up.
8_19	0.0	The ash could be accompanied by lava flow and possibly blow much farther northwest, depending on the weather, and cause health problems for anyone with asthma or other respiratory diseases, said Dr. Thomas Pierson, a geologist with the geological survey.
8_20	0.0	And if the mountain glacier melted as a result of an eruption, it could create a "debris flow" cascading down the mountain, officials said.
8_21	0.13636363636363635	The earthquakes recorded over the past week, subsiding briefly after the Friday explosion, were the most intense seismic activity on the mountain since before the massive May 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction.
8_22	0.0	Before Friday, the mountain had been dormant for 18 years.
8_23	0.0	Scientists said they had initially expected any eruption to be fairly minor, but were now saying it could be more serious.
8_24	0.0	Castle Rock residents, many of whom witnessed the 1980 explosion, which dumped truckloads of ash on this town, seemed to be taking the new development in stride and expressed little worry on Saturday, saying nothing could compare to the 1980 event.
8_25	0.0	"I know it might sound like the strangest thing in the world," said Laura Dodd, the owner of Lady Bug Antiques in downtown Castle Rock, who observed scores of tourists passing through town Saturday on their way to or from the mountain.

8_29	0.0	Bobbie Stout, the cashier at North Fork Survivors, a novelty shop on Route 504 about 25 miles west of the mountain, said she had seen cars "rushing up the mountain" before they were evacuated Saturday afternoon, and that there was an excitement in the air.
8_30	0.0	"I lived through the first one," Stout said, adding that she was slightly concerned about the glacier melting but otherwise calm.
8_31	0.0	"I'm not all that nervous."
9_0	0.4375	Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
9_1	0.18181818181818182	They said the next eruption was imminent or in progress, and could threaten life and property in the remote area near the volcano.
9_2	0.25	Hundreds of visitors at the building closest to the volcano _ Johnston Ridge Observatory five miles (eight kilometers) away _ were asked to leave Saturday.
9_3	0.0	They went quickly to their cars and drove away, with some relocating several miles (kilometers) north to Coldwater Ridge Visitors Center, which officials said was safe.
9_4	0.42857142857142855	The volcano alert of Mount St. Helens was raised to Level 3, which "indicates we feel an eruption is imminent, or is in progress," said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Tom Pierson from the observatory.
9_5	0.0	He said Saturday afternoon that an explosion probably would happen within the next 24 hours.
9_6	0.22727272727272727	Pierson said the volcano has released more seismic energy since quake activity began Sept. 23 than it has at any point since its devastating May 18, 1980, eruption, which killed 57 people and coated much of the Northwest with ash.
9_7	0.0	But scientists expect the impending eruption to be much smaller than the 1980 blast.
9_8	0.14285714285714285	A day after the volcano spewed a plume of steam and ash thousands of feet (meters) into the air, there was a very brief steam release Saturday _ a puff of white cloud, followed by a dust-raising landslide in the crater.
9_9	0.0	A volcanic tremor signal that came next was what prompted the heightened alert level.
9_10	0.0	The signal "was far stronger after today's steam eruption" than the tremor that followed Friday's blast, Steele said.
9_11	0.0	"We were picking it up throughout western Washington and into central Oregon.
9_12	0.0	Yesterday we had a very weak tremor signal."
9_13	0.0	A tremor _ a steady vibration _ "indicates movement of gases or fluid within the volcano," Steele said, while individual earthquakes indicate "a pounding and breaking of rock."
9_14	0.15	Saturday's tremor lasted about an hour before it was drowned out by a series of earthquakes _ one or two a minute, with a maximum magnitude of "well over 2," said Tom Yelin, a USGS seismologist at the UW lab in Seattle.
9_15	0.13636363636363635	Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.
9_16	0.0	Norton said the chances of an eruption or lava flow have increased, and that the volcano most likely will see moderate ash eruptions.
9_17	0.0	"The greatest concern at this point is an ash plume and the spread of ash itself that might come from an explosion," Norton said.
9_18	0.0	"This is a concern for aircraft travel."
9_19	0.0	The growing consensus among scientists is that new magma is probably entering the volcano's upper levels, possibly bringing with it volatile gases that could lead to eruptions, said Bill Steele at the University of Washington's seismic laboratory in Seattle.
9_20	0.0	Explosions from the crater could occur without warning, possibly throwing rock onto the flanks of the volcano, the USGS said in a news release.
9_21	0.07692307692307693	Still, scientists said the evacuation of the observatory was primarily a precaution in case of heavy ash discharge, which could make it difficult to drive.
9_22	0.0	"We still feel the risk is confined to this area," Pierson said.
9_23	0.5384615384615384	No communities are near Mount St. Helens; the closest, Toutle, is 30 miles (48 kilometers) west.
9_24	0.0	Near the town, an impromptu tailgate party was under way along the shore of Silver Lake, which offers a straight-on view of the mountain from a safe distance.
9_25	0.0	Dozens of cars lined both sides of State Route 504, their festive occupants spilled out along the roadside.
9_26	0.0	Folks set up lawn chairs and cameras on tripods.
9_27	0.0	Radios were tuned to news reports, and a nearby pizza joint was doing a thriving business.
9_28	0.0	"I missed it the first time back in the '80s eruption and I certainly wasn't going to this time," said welder Dean Strahm, 48, of Gold Bar, who brought camping gear and a cooler and planned to stay all night.
9_29	0.0	"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience so I thought I'd come on down."
9_30	0.0	The 1980 blast obliterated the top 1,300 feet (390 meters) of the volcano, devastated miles (kilometers) of forest and buried the North Fork of the Toutle River in debris and ash as much as 600 feet (180 meters) deep.
9_31	0.06666666666666667	The latest seismic activity "probably just reflects the fact that more rock needs to be broken for magma to reach the surface," said geologist Dan Dzurisin at the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcanic Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south.
9_32	0.0	The 1980 eruption reamed open the route to the surface, and for six years smaller eruptions piled lava into the massive dome that marks the main conduit for magma.
9_33	0.0	Friday's relatively small eruption, which generated a plume of ash and smoke 16,000 feet (4,800 meters) high, was the first since a 1986 dome-building event at the volcano.
9_34	0.0	Scientists had believed the recent flurry of shallow earthquakes may reflect movement of magma that came up the volcano's pipe during a 1998 swarm of quakes, but Pierson said Saturday's activity suggested at least some new magma was involved, making a larger explosion more likely.
9_35	0.0	Air sampling had detected only tiny amounts of the volcanic gases that new magma produces, but scientists said the gases could be sealed inside the system or have been dissolved by water on the mountain.
9_36	0.0	The volcano holds a 600-foot (180-meter)-deep glacier.
9_37	0.0	Melting of the glacier could trigger debris flows down onto the barren pumice plain at the foot of the mountain, the USGS said, noting a "very low probability" that downstream communities would be affected.
9_38	0.3181818181818182	Few people live near the mountain, the centerpiece of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Seattle.
