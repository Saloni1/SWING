1_44	0.05	Still, the current regulations have created a quagmire of consumer confusion and set up potential health crises that even industry officials say could ultimately hurt producers as well as users of herbal products.
1_45	0.07692307692307693	Under the 1994 law, consumers have no assurance that an herbal product contains what the label says it does or that it is free from harmful contaminants.
1_46	0.0	Independent analyses of some products, particularly those containing costly or scarce herbs, revealed that some have little or none of the purported active ingredient listed on the label.
1_47	0.0	Adding to the confusion is that botanical makers are allowed to describe products only in terms of their effects on the structure or function of the body, not their potential health benefits.
1_48	0.0	Thus, a product label might say ``promotes cardiac function'' but it cannot say ``lowers cholesterol.''
1_49	0.0	Likewise, although the law does allow health warnings on the label, most manufacturers have yet to include them.

1_59	0.10526315789473684	Because plants contain a mixture of relatively diluted chemicals, they naturally tend to have milder actions, both in their therapeutic benefits and side effects, than the concentrated, single chemicals in most drugs.
1_60	0.0	Thus, botanicals generally take longer to act than regular pharmaceuticals and few have the potency of a prescription, the one possible exception being saw palmetto, which a well-designed study indicated may be as helpful for an enlarged prostate as the more expensive and riskier drug, Proscar.
1_61	0.0	The combination of chemicals in botanicals is potentially both a plus and a minus.
1_62	0.0	When two or more chemicals enhance one another's activity, the therapeutic benefit could theoretically exceed that of an isolated substance formulated as a drug.
1_63	0.0	Mark Blumenthal, who heads the American Botanical Council, noted that the herb St. John's wort, widely used in Germany and increasingly in the United States to counter mild depression, is standardized for a substance called hypericin.

1_65	0.0	Rather, other substances in the herb seem to have diverse actions on brain chemicals, all of which work together to counter depression.
1_66	0.0	Equally possible, though, when using an herb with two or more active chemicals, is that one will cancel the benefits of another or introduce a hazard.
1_67	0.0	Without careful chemical tests and large, well-controlled clinical trials such actions are often hard to detect.
1_68	0.045454545454545456	Consumer confidence in herbal medicine is bolstered by the common but erroneous assumption that ``natural'' equals ``safe'' and the public's failure to realize that many plants contain chemicals that are potent drugs or outright poisons.

1_73	0.15384615384615385	However, when used in uncontrolled dosages or by people with certain underlying health problems, it can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure and, in its herbal form, has been responsible for serious adverse reactions and dozens of deaths, mainly among people who inappropriately used it as a stimulant or diet aid.
1_74	0.08	Complicating the safety issue is the fact, shown in several recent surveys, that most patients fail to tell their physicians they use herbal supplements and thus sometimes risk dangerous drug interactions or endure costly tests or treatments when an herb causes an unrecognized side effect.

1_83	0.0	However, thousands of studies of botanicals have been completed abroad _ mainly in Germany _ that strongly suggest a health-promoting role for more than 200 plant products.
1_84	0.0	Germany's Commission E evaluated 380 botanicals, approving 254 as safe and reasonably effective and disapproving 126 as ineffective, unsafe or both.

1_86	0.0	Whereas standard testing of a drug for approval by the FDA can cost as much as $500 million per product _ a prohibitive amount for companies to spend on botanicals that cannot be patented _ tests to establish ``reasonable certainty'' would cost only $1 million to $2 million, Tyler estimated.
1_87	0.029411764705882353	In June 1996, Dr. Robert Temple, director of medical policy for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation, suggested that, rather than subjecting botanicals to the extensive tests required for drugs, the agency might consider applying less stringent criteria to assess an herb's effects, at least when a product is to be used only for a short time.

4_15	0.21428571428571427	``You see more and more dietary supplements sold right next to over-the-counter drugs,'' said William Schultz, the FDA's deputy commissioner for policy.
4_16	0.0	``There is a risk that the line will blur.''
4_17	0.0	It is already blurry.
4_18	0.0	``Foods are medicines; medicines are foods,'' said Loren Israelson, executive director of the Utah Natural Products Alliance, a trade group based in Salt Lake City.
4_19	0.0	``If you drink coffee in the morning, why are you drinking coffee?
4_20	0.0	You're looking for the caffeine, a stimulant.
4_21	0.0	That same caffeine is sold over the counter as No-Doz.
4_22	0.0	That's a drug when it's in a pill form, and it's a food when it's in coffee.
4_23	0.0	Why is that?''
4_24	0.0	The FDA struggled with such questions for decades.
4_25	0.11764705882352941	But with the passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the law under which the Cholestin case will be decided, the agency's task grew even more vexing.
4_26	0.1	The new law took dietary supplements out of the underground and into the mainstream, giving manufacturers like Pharmanex the long-sought right to advertise the potential benefits of herbs, even if the evidence for those benefits was sketchy.
4_27	0.0	If the products were safe, companies could say what they wished, so long as they did not claim their products could prevent, treat or cure disease.
4_28	0.36363636363636365	Thus, McGlashan can advertise that Cholestin ``promotes healthy cholesterol,'' but not that it ``prevents heart attack or stroke.''
4_29	0.0	``For the first time,'' he said, ``we can educate the American consumer about what the product does.
4_30	0.0	We don't have to rely on a person in a health food store to explain it.''
4_31	0.0	Since the law was passed, the FDA has received about 2,300 notifications from manufacturers intending to make claims about their products, and has objected to about 150 of them.
4_32	0.06666666666666667	It has also proposed a rule that would restrict, but not eliminate, the manufacturer's ability to use the herbal stimulant ephedra, which has been linked to more than a dozen deaths nationwide.
4_33	0.05263157894736842	But these actions, says former Food and Drugs Commissioner David Kessler, are hardly enough to make a dent in the rampant proliferation of herbal remedies that he says are ineffective at best and unsafe at worst.
4_34	0.0	``Just walk into your pharmacy; it's out of control,'' said Kessler, who waged a bitter, unsuccessful battle against the 1994 law as commissioner.
4_35	0.0	``Efficacy is now defined as what sells off the shelves.
4_36	0.0	The agency is powerless.''
4_37	0.0	While the law was a disaster for regulators, it was a windfall for businesses that sell herbs and vitamins.
4_38	0.09090909090909091	Indeed, after the act was adopted, annual sales of dietary supplements in the United States skyrocketed, jumping from more than $8 billion in 1994 to nearly $12 billion last year, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, a trade publication.
4_39	0.041666666666666664	So furious has the growth been that one analyst, Matthew Patsky of the Boston-based investment banking firm of Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, said some of the nation's biggest pharmaceutical companies are now planning to introduce their own lines of herbal products.
4_40	0.0	That worries Schultz, the FDA deputy commissioner for policy.
4_41	0.13333333333333333	``If companies that would have tested their products and sold them as drugs are now going to not test them and sell them as dietary supplements,'' he said, ``then we have lost information about the safety and efficacy of those products.''
4_42	0.0	Among the law's beneficiaries was McGlashan, a 34-year-old Stanford University business school graduate who studied Chinese history as an undergraduate.
4_43	0.0	With the baby boomers growing older, McGlashan sensed a growing demand for natural medicines the Chinese have used for centuries.

4_45	0.11764705882352941	McGlashan says he had a vision for his business; he wanted to apply ``pharmaceutical rigors'' to the dietary supplement industry, using research to persuade consumers that Eastern therapies worked.
4_46	0.0	In early 1994, he Dr. Michael Chang, a medical chemist and former pharmaceutical industry researcher who had set up a manufacturing plant to produce herbal medicines in Huzhou, China, near Shanghai.
4_47	0.07142857142857142	Chang scoured Chinese research for promising herbal products and identified 5,000; together, he and McGlashan narrowed the list to 30.
4_48	0.0	By early 1995, Pharmanex was born, with headquarters in Simi Valley, Calif.
4_49	0.0	Red yeast rice, called Hong Qu, was one of the most promising projects on its list.
4_50	0.0	``We know Hong Qu has been used for centuries, but we don't know why it lowers cholesterol,'' Chang said.
4_51	0.0	``We need to find out.''
4_52	0.0	The 1994 law, McGlashan said, made it worth investing in science.
4_53	0.0	The company introduced Cholestin at the end of 1996, after nearly three years of study.
4_54	0.0	Most recently, Pharmanex enlisted Dr. David Heber, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California at Los Angeles, to study the effects of Cholestin in adults with moderately elevated cholesterol.
4_55	0.0	The study, financed by Pharmanex, compared the cholesterol levels of 42 adults who took 2.5 grams of Cholestin every day for three months with the levels in 41 adults who were given placebos.
4_56	0.0	Heber said the total cholesterol counts of those who took the supplement dropped, on average, from 250 to 210.
4_57	0.0	Heber dismisses the contention that red yeast rice is a drug; instead he calls it ``a functional food.''
4_58	0.0	The same cholesterol-lowering ingredient in lovastatin, he notes, occurs in even higher concentrations in oyster mushrooms, commonly used in Asian cooking.
4_59	0.0	And nobody, he said, is trying to ban mushrooms.
4_60	0.08695652173913043	However, Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of psychopharmacology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, contends the current distinction between dietary supplements and drugs is based on semantics, not biology, and that both should be carefully regulated.
4_61	0.0	``If there is a biologically active component in the supplement, to say it is not a drug is illogical because it will have a similar effect,'' he said.
4_62	0.0	Companies like Pharmanex, he added, ``want to be able to implant the idea in the public that the drug is medically beneficial'' without doing rigorous research drug companies must do to obtain approval.
4_63	0.0	That kind of science, McGlashan admits, would cost far too much for a small company like his.
4_64	0.07692307692307693	Yet with a decent body of research behind Cholestin, he said, he at one time envisioned himself becoming the FDA's poster boy for good behavior.
4_65	0.0	Instead, he received a visit from FDA investigators in April of last year; the agency had received complaints that Cholestin contained lovastatin, both from a pharmacist and from Merck &AMP; Co, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Mevacor, the cholestorol-lowering drug that contains the same ingredient as Cholestin.
4_66	0.0	Shortly thereafter, federal authorities impounded 10 tons of red yeast rice that had come into the Port of Los Angeles from China; the shipment is now sitting in a storage facility in Mexico.
4_67	0.0	Then on May 20, the FDA notified McGlashan that it considered Cholestin illegal, a move that prompted the company to ask for a hearing before Kimball of the U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.
4_68	0.0	McGlashan contends that, at its root, the dispute is an economic one.
4_69	0.0	Cholestin, he said, is sold to people who are too healthy for Mevacor, the Merck drug.
4_70	0.0	Merck, he contends, is making a power grab for that market by trying to push Cholestin off the shelves _ a charge denied by Jan Weiner, a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical company.
4_71	0.0	While the court case is pending, McGlashan said, sales of Cholestin are booming.
4_72	0.0	One woman recently wrote him to say she had purchased eight months' worth of the capsules.
4_73	0.0	Even his mother called, he said, asking, ``How am I supposed to get my Cholestin?''
4_74	0.0	For now, McGlashan has no answer.
4_75	0.0	Standing outside the low-pressure room where the encapsulating machine was spinning, a lab coat covering his royal blue shirt and Hermes tie, he looked a little wistful.

5_25	0.0	Isn't it restricted to students of the United States and its territories?
5_26	0.0	A: The competition, sponsored by Scripps Howard Newspapers, has only these restrictions: contestants must speak English and be younger than 16, and cannot have passed beyond the eighth grade at the time of their school finals.
5_27	0.0	All have qualified by competing in previous spelling bees sponsored by their local newspapers.
5_28	0.0	The 249 contestants this year represented 49 states (no Vermont entry), several U.S. territories, Mexico, the Bahamas and Jamaica.

6_4	0.09090909090909091	The danger, he said, is that some people with potentially life-threatening illnesses will use the products in place of standard medical treatments.
6_5	0.0	That has always been a risk, but the marketing giants now pushing into the industry can pitch these formulas to more consumers, he said.
6_6	0.0	``The way they are positioned in the marketplace can lead people down roads to ineffective treatments,'' Kessler said, pointing to products whose names, he argued, could cause consumers to think they could be used instead of prescription drugs.

6_9	0.0	In some cases, critics say, the supplements can be quite dangerous indeed.
6_10	0.08333333333333333	The FDA, for example, is attempting to rein in the use of the herbal stimulant ephedra, which is sold by various companies in a formula under different names.
6_11	0.0	The formula, which manufacturers say is safe, has been linked to more than a dozen deaths nationwide.
6_12	0.3157894736842105	Marketers promise that the pills provide an amphetaminelike rush, aid in weight loss and even increase sexual sensation, but medical experts say they can cause heart attacks, strokes and seizures.
6_13	0.0	The big-name herbal pill dispensers now entering the market say they are sticking to more ``mainstream'' substances and argue that those formulas are safe and effective when taken by healthy people in recommended doses.
6_14	0.0	Besides, they say, unlike the little-known manufacturers that once dominated the industry, they have the research and development budgets and purchasing clout to insure product quality.
6_15	0.0	``We spend tens of millions of dollars putting together manufacturing and quality-control processes,'' said Elliot Friedman, chairman and chief executive of Pharmaprint Inc., which is producing the supplements that American Home Products is planning to market under the Centrum name.

6_17	0.0	That may be, but the critics say consumers have a false sense of security about the regulatory oversight of supplements.
6_18	0.058823529411764705	They mistakenly assume, the critics contend, that the supplements are subject to the same scrutiny as toothpaste, cough drops and other seemingly benign products under the FDA's watch.
6_19	0.07692307692307693	The agency requires those goods to carry general cautionary labeling and dosage information, and it imposes limits on the claims that can be made in marketing.
6_20	0.0	Herbal supplements are regulated by a looser set of standards.
6_21	0.125	Before the passage in 1994 of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, manufacturers were prohibited, for instance, from making claims about the potential benefits of their products.
6_22	0.0	But the revised guidelines allow companies to advertise the health effects of herbal supplements _ without having to conclusively prove their effectiveness _ so long as the wording does not suggest that the products prevent, treat or cure disease.
6_23	0.0	That gives companies much greater range in making product claims than manufacturers of, say, mouthwash.
6_24	0.0	While a company cannot claim an herbal supplement cures cancer or relieves depression, for example, it can say that it ``promotes prostate health'' or ``aids in mental focus.''
6_25	0.0	Critics also worry that pharmaceutical companies will attempt to classify some products as herbal supplements instead of as drugs to skirt the rigorous process required to bring a drug to market.
6_26	0.0	That complaint is at the heart of a battle between the FDA and Pharmanex Inc., which manufactures a product called Cholestin, which it sells as an supplement in Wal-Mart and other big chains.
6_27	0.0	The FDA wants to ban the substance, maintaining that it is an unapproved drug because it contains a natural form of a key chemical in the cholesterol-lowering prescription drug Mevacor, made by Merck &AMP; Co.
6_28	0.05	Last month, Pharmanex won the first round in the battle _ which was prompted by Merck's complaints about the product _ when a judge issued a preliminary injunction lifting the FDA's administrative ban of Cholestin.
6_29	0.0	The company contends that the product is a natural alternative for people who are too healthy to take the drug.

9_6	0.0	And, more importantly, are they safe?
9_7	0.1111111111111111	While the FDA can alert consumers to products that could be dangerous, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 limits the agency's latitude in regulating supplements.
9_8	0.16666666666666666	Unlike drugs that get FDA approval before they are marketed, dietary supplements must be proven unsafe before regulators can restrict the use of a product.
9_9	0.0	While the FDA forbids labels that ``state or imply that the product can help diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent a disease (for example, `cures cancer' or `treats arthritis')'' consumers should be wary of products that are marketed as ``miracle cures,'' ``wonder drugs,'' and ``new breakthroughs,'' according to the agency's website.
9_10	0.2857142857142857	In recent years, the FDA has issued warnings about the danger of over-the-counter supplements containing ephedrine, a powerful heart stimulant, and gamma butryolactone, or GBL, a central nervous system depressant.
9_11	0.0	In January, muscle and performance boosting products containing GBL had to be pulled from gym and store shelves after the FDA banned the product when some consumers experienced vomiting, slowed heart rate, seizures, comas, and even death.
9_12	0.25	Weight loss, muscle building, and energy boosting products containing ephedrine have not been recalled by the FDA, although the agency issued several warnings after it investigated more than 800 adverse health events including heart attack, stroke, seizure, and more than 30 deaths associated with products containing ephedrine.
9_13	0.21052631578947367	In 1997, the FDA advised consumers to restrict their intake of ephedrine (derived from the ephedra plant) to 8 mg per dose and no more than 24 mg per day and not to use the product for more than seven days.
9_14	0.35294117647058826	Products containing ephedrine _ commonly labeled as ephedra, ma huang Chinese ephedra, and epitonin _ are often found in weight-loss, energy boosting, and body building supplements.
9_15	0.23076923076923078	But some in the dietary supplement industry are at odds with the government's descriptions that some supplements _ particularly those containing ephedrine _ are dangerous.
9_16	0.05714285714285714	In May, Metabolife International Inc., sued WCVB-TV Channel 5, its anchor Susan Wornick, and Dr. George L. Blackburn of Harvard Medical School after the Boston station reported on health risks related to the use of ephedrine-containing weight-loss dietary supplements, including the top-selling Metabolife 356, which the San Diego-based company makes.
9_17	0.0	The report included a comment from Blackburn, who, when discussing the safety of ephedrine-containing products such as Metabolife, said ``you can die'' from taking them.
9_18	0.0	Metabolife claims his comments, as well as the broadcast, were false, and are damaging to the company, which sold an estimated $600 million worth of the supplements last year.

9_20	0.0	Blackburn's attorney Jeffrey R. Martin called Metabolife's lawsuit ``frivolous'' and said ``we are doing our best to get it dismissed.''
9_21	0.041666666666666664	Metabolife's president Michael J. Ellis has also threatened to sue the Washington Post over a similar report and has battled successfully in states, such as Texas, to stop legislatures from requiring prescriptions for weight-loss products containing ephedrine.
9_22	0.0	Nevertheless, some stores have voluntarily pulled ephedrine from their shelves.
9_23	0.08	Bread and Circus Whole Foods Markets, a small Massachusetts chain, stopped selling about 12 products containing ephedra around the time the FDA warned in 1996 that the product was an ``amphetamine-like stimulant'' that can damage the heart and nervous system.
9_24	0.0	``We pulled everything.
9_25	0.10526315789473684	None of our stores carry ephedra products or ma Huang _ `speed' _ as we like to call it,'' said Allyn Kunz nutrition coordinator for Bread and Circus's northeast region.
9_26	0.09090909090909091	``Some companies actually changed their formulas so we would keep their products on the shelf,'' she said, while others ``took out the ma huang and added another herb very high in caffeine called guarnana and they advertise it as `ephedra free,''' Kunz said.
9_27	0.0	But Bread and Circus doesn't carry products containing guarana either, she added.
9_28	0.0	While the majority of supplements are not dangerous, consumers shouldn't buy or use products just because the label says ``natural,'' according to Dr. David Levitsky a nutrition and psychology professor at Cornell University.
9_29	0.0	``Everything is natural,'' Levitsky said.
9_30	0.15384615384615385	``Somehow there is the idea that if you use a plant directly or extract a tea it will be more effective and have less side effects (than approved drugs) and that's not true.''
9_31	0.0	For Levitsky, who is studying the effects of several herbal supplements, memory-aiding products and mood supplements seem to show the most promise.
9_32	0.0	Despite volumes of testimonials from users, many who have been paid to make them, fitness, energy, and weight-loss supplements don't appear to produce a measurable effect, he said.
9_33	0.0	Where weight-loss is concerned, ``the more you believe in them the more they work... there is something to the placebo effect,'' Levitsky said.
