0_1	0.56194845	The Army's surgeon general on Thursday criticized stories in The Washington Post disclosing problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, saying the series unfairly characterized the living conditions and care for soldiers recuperating from wounds at the hospital's facilities.
0_2	0.4144904	``I'm not sure it was an accurate representation," Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley, chief of the Army Medical Command which oversees Walter Reed and all Army health care, told reporters during a news conference.
0_3	0.086477521	``It was a one-sided representation."
0_4	0.24622062	Until now, the Army had not challenged any aspect of the Post series.
0_5	0.28958535	Army and Defense Department leaders have promised to repair squalid conditions in Building 18, a former hotel outside the Walter Reed gate where 76 wounded soldiers are housed as outpatients.
0_6	0.11070356	They have also promised to address bureaucratic problems that have impeded care.
0_7	0.25134822	The two-part newspaper series reported that many soldiers spend 18 months or more at Walter Reed.
0_8	0.10926548	It quoted many patients and their families describing a bureaucratic indifference to medical needs.
0_9	0.098545982	And it described rooms in Building 18 with mold, leaky plumbing and holes in ceilings.
0_10	0.1218287	While acknowledging ``pretty distressing" conditions in some rooms in Building 18, Kiley said the problems were not widespread, nor symptoms of a system that allows soldiers to languish.
0_11	0.19032488	The building is not ``emblematic of a process that abandons soldiers," said Kiley, who was commander at Walter Reed before becoming surgeon general in 2004.
0_12	0.083474125	``I want to reset the thinking," Kiley added.
0_13	0.17232941	``While we have some issues here, this is not a horrific, catastrophic failure at Walter Reed."
0_14	0.17769518	Asked to elaborate on his comments after the news conference at the facility, Kiley said he did not dispute any of the facts in the Post stories.
0_15	0.079534642	``It's not the accuracy I question, it's the characterization," he said.
0_16	0.12380129	Kiley said the Army was beginning to study ways to streamline the medical bureaucracy, including the process by which soldiers are medically evaluated and either discharged or returned to active duty.
0_17	0.083440512	``That's going to take more than a couple of weeks, but we're going to get at it," he said.
0_18	0.10973578	Kiley's comments came at the conclusion of a media tour during which reporters and television cameras were escorted through Building 18 to view conditions and repairs.
0_19	0.091602567	Rooms had been painted, plumbing repaired and floors reeked of disinfectant.
0_20	0.093290249	``It's not the Ritz-Carlton at Pentagon City, I'll grant you that," Kiley said, surveying the newly cleaned, repaired and repainted room where until recently Army Spec.
0_21	0.10291501	Jeremy Duncan lived amid black mold and a hole in the ceiling above the shower.
0_22	0.11481338	Duncan, who suffered a broken neck while on patrol in Iraq last year, was moved to a new room after the Post story described his living conditions.
0_23	0.095462383	He said he had not suffered any reprisals.
0_24	0.098626596	``Believe it or not, people were actually happy about the fact that someone spoke up," Duncan said.
0_25	0.096393049	An Army sergeant who oversees the management of Building 18 said three requests for service were made to repair Duncan's room -- one in November, one in January, and one last week -- but nothing happened.
0_26	0.098057983	Kiley said that while repairs to Building 18 are nearly complete, the aging facility needs a top-to-bottom renovation.
0_27	0.094162969	``That's tough to do while you're trying to take care of soldiers," he said.
0_28	0.098455099	In another development Thursday, the White House announced that President Bush plans nominate Ward Casscells to replace William Winkenwerder as assistant defense secretary for health affairs.
0_29	0.1084293	The Pentagon said Winkenwerder's departure was already planned and not related to the problems at Walter Reed.
1_0	0.15521561	The US Defense Department said Tuesday it is reviewing the way wounded service members are cared for at military hospitals following disclosures of shocking bureaucratic neglect.
1_1	0.47099187	"There's plenty of outrage," said White House spokesman Tony Snow, responding to a Washington Post report citing bitter complaints from veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center outside Washington.
1_2	0.18885036	But he said the army was carrying out an investigation of conditions at the hospital and that there should be no doubt about President George W. Bush's commitment to veterans.
1_3	0.049682331	"The men and the women who have gone and fought for our country over there, they deserve the best care," Snow said.
1_4	0.3662177	The Pentagon said reviews of medical care at the premier military hospitals, Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center, have been launched by the army and navy's respective civilian chiefs.
1_5	0.22538064	An independent review group also will be formed to look into outpatient care and administrative process at the two hospitals.
1_6	0.18293719	The action followed an investigation by the Washington Post that found that seriously wounded service members treated as outpatients at Walter Reed lingered there virtually forgotten for 18 months or more because of bureaucratic snafus.
1_7	0.17400078	Walter Reed and the National Naval Hospital at Bethesda, Maryland near Washington are both renowned for their care of soldiers with combat injuries.
1_8	0.13186753	But the Post said the poor treatment came later in the bureaucratic handling of some 700 people wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan who are being treated as outpatients but who are quartered on hospital grounds or nearby buildings.
1_9	0.096617447	The Post said some soldiers were staying in a building infested with mold and rodents and roaches.
1_10	0.096019945	In other cases, it took months for wounded soldiers to get disability pay or a decision on whether they would remain in the service.
1_11	0.12729435	"We are committed to improving the clinical and administrative processes, including improving temporary living conditions for our service members and families," William Winkenwerder, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs said.
1_12	0.11237877	A senior US defense official, who asked not to be identified, said Defense Secretary Robert Gates urged the review and that results be quickly reported.
1_13	0.13560869	Gates met with top army officials earlier in the day, the official said.
1_14	0.1067673	The army also is investigating allegations raised by the Post that a former official in charge of seeing that private donations got to wounded soldiers was at the same time raising funds for a private charity.
1_15	0.099334201	In the US Senate, Democratic lawmakers said they were appalled and called for legislation that would require inspections and other measures designed to improve conditions at military hospitals.
1_16	0.097283789	"The brave men and women wounded at war should receive the best we have to offer and the highest quality of care," said Democratic Senator Barack Obama, a presidential hopeful for the 2008 race and outspoken opponent of the Iraq war.
1_17	0.097670105	Obama and Senator Claire McCaskill said they would introduce a bill seeking to raise standards at military hospitals for returning soldiers wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan.
1_18	0.097835666	The proposed "legislation would cut red tape, improve service, and require frequent inspections of all active duty military hospitals," Obama said in a statement.

2_1	0.26730518	It's not every day one gets to witness a whitewash in action, but Walter Reed Army Medical Center provided just such an opportunity Thursday.
2_2	0.19014849	In Sunday's Washington Post, Dana Priest and Anne Hull described the woeful conditions of Room 205 in Walter Reed's Building 18: ``Behind the door of Army Spc. Jeremy Duncan's room, part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air, weighted down with black mold.
2_3	0.05529085	When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up, he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole."
2_4	0.17936838	The Army mobilized.
2_5	0.0175086	Painters were deployed to cover the offending wall with a fresh coat of white semigloss.
2_6	0.022296738	And television crews were invited in to inspect the result.
2_7	0.10874821	``Some of the paint is still wet against that wall, so be careful," Walter Reed public affairs officer Donald Vandrey, standing on the bed in his socks, advised the film crews.
2_8	0.073471975	``They just finished repainting it about 10 minutes ago."
2_9	0.075844425	Mission accomplished?
2_10	0.080721068	Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley thought so.
2_11	0.27028528	After the media tour of Building 18, the Army's surgeon general gave a news conference.
2_12	0.088872018	``I do not consider Building 18 to be substandard," he said of a facility Priest and Hull found full of ``mouse droppings, belly-up cockroaches, stained carpets, cheap mattresses" and other delights.
2_13	0.050158197	``We needed to do a better job on some of those rooms, and those of you that got in today saw that we frankly have fixed all of those problems.
2_14	0.041070085	They weren't serious, and there weren't a lot of them."
2_15	0.052957738	Kiley might have had a stronger case if men wearing Tyvek hazmat suits and gas masks hadn't walked through the lobby while the camera crews waited for the tour to start, or if he hadn't acknowledged, moments later, that the entire building would have to be closed for a complete renovation.
2_16	0.099020703	The general also seemed to miss a larger point identified by other officials: Walter Reed's problem isn't of mice and mold but a bureaucracy that has impeded the recovery of wounded soldiers.
2_17	0.19188244	The Army's vice chief of staff, only 24 hours earlier, decried ``a breakdown in leadership" for the conditions in the place.
2_18	0.13703998	And Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., noted that ``you could put all the wounded soldiers in the Ritz-Carlton, and it wouldn't fix the personnel management and record-keeping problems that keep them languishing in outpatient limbo out there for months."
2_19	0.082181144	``We're not letting soldiers languish," came Kiley's reply.
2_20	0.086991601	For all the stagecraft, there was still broken glass in the driveway of Building 18 Thursday, a banana peel on the steps and an empty Budweiser can in the shrubbery.
2_21	0.063727056	There were signs of hasty repairs: a plumber's truck outside, dust masks and spray cleaners on window sills, rat poison outside the dumpster, and a discarded box proclaiming ``Emergency Exit Lighting Fixture."
2_22	0.082062938	Construction workers came and went.
2_23	0.074671259	The base's public-affairs crew arrived 25 minutes late for the tour but got right to work.
2_24	0.10392577	``Some of these people are not on our list and are not coming in," announced Lori Calvillo, Walter Reed's chief spokeswoman.
2_25	0.089655703	``C-SPAN, you're not on the list.
2_26	0.092980008	You're not coming in."
2_27	0.11860443	She then attempted to evict a Washington Post reporter, who appealed, loudly, to Kiley.
2_28	0.086161156	The tour began in the game room, where soldiers shot pool and watched a plasma TV.
2_29	0.088445812	From there, the tourists climbed a stairwell smelling of chlorine bleach to a floor smelling of fresh paint.
2_30	0.090143128	``In the next room, there's a little water drop on the ceiling; you can get a nice shot of it," Kiley joked.
2_31	0.090469708	Inside Room 416, there was indeed some rainwater dripping into a wastebasket, a missing lampshade, some loose wallpaper and a mirror on the floor -- but neither rodents nor fungus visible.
2_32	0.09337984	Then it was down to Room 205, crammed with Tilex, sealant, paint rollers, a dropcloth and ceramic tiles.
2_33	0.094044106	Spokesman Vandrey spoke like a real estate agent: ``There was no plumbing leakage in the bathroom.
2_34	0.092453371	That was all condensation."
2_35	0.095802123	Outside the room, a man spoke urgently into his cellphone: ``The drywall has to dry before they can paint."
2_36	0.097579935	A few doors down was Spc. Duncan, in his new room.
2_37	0.096768308	``Unfortunately, I had to stand up and tell them, `Hey, the room is messed up,"' he told a Voice of America camera.
2_38	0.091605253	``I got my point across."
2_39	0.099393759	He sure did -- and that's why Kiley, who was the commander at Walter Reed before assuming his current role in 2004, found himself staring into a bank of 12 cameras Thursday.
2_40	0.11094179	Missing was Maj. Gen. George Weightman, the current Walter Reed commander -- ``called away to important business," Kiley explained.
2_41	0.090070666	At times, Kiley appeared to acknowledge a systemic problem.
2_42	0.10066906	He promised to ``go at this thing soup to nuts," adding: ``We're gonna get at it real quickly."
2_43	0.10067478	But then he quibbled with the scope of the problem.
2_44	0.096772596	``Some of this bureaucracy, as much as it frustrates us, I'm not sure that's a breakdown in leadership," he reasoned.
2_45	0.11081949	He then attacked the ``one-sided representation" of the Post reporting.
2_46	0.10051275	``I do not think that Building 8" -- he apparently meant 18 -- ``is emblematic of a process of Walter Reed that has abandoned soldiers and their families," Kiley said.
2_47	0.10136503	``I want to reset the thinking that while we have some issues here, this is not a horrific, catastrophic failure at Walter Reed."
2_48	0.089250747	Back in Room 205, the whitewash was almost dry.
3_0	0.46448736	WASHINGTON A top Army general vowed Wednesday to personally oversee the upgrading of Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Building 18, a dilapidated former hotel that houses wounded soldiers as outpatients.
3_1	0.18052929	Gen. Richard Cody, the Army vice chief of staff, used terminology similar to that of a military campaign to describe his plan to overhaul the broken building, including giving it a more ``appropriate" name, and the sluggish bureaucracy for outpatient care.
3_2	0.11439547	``We own that building, and we're going to take charge of it," Cody said at the Pentagon.
3_3	0.18419535	``The senior Army leadership takes full responsibility for the lack of quality of life at Building 18, and we're going to fix it."
3_4	0.10984637	Cody blamed ``a breakdown in leadership" for the troubling conditions but said no one has been fired or relieved of command.
3_5	0.077063235	He did point to lower-ranking officers and noncommissioned officers lacking ``the right experience and the authority to be able to execute some of the missions."
3_6	0.071262814	``That's what we're correcting right now," he said.
3_7	0.18554592	Cody and William Winkenwerder Jr., the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said at a news conference that they frequently visit Walter Reed and were surprised and disappointed by the living conditions and the fact that they had learned about them from media reports.
3_8	0.48020776	The Washington Post reported Sunday and Monday on the challenges facing outpatients at Walter Reed.
3_9	0.081013969	``We get concerns all the time directed to us.
3_10	0.060361969	But we never got a concern sent our way about this issue, which is a little surprising.
3_11	0.083751194	I'm not sure why that is," Winkenwerder said.
3_12	0.14975806	Standards of medical care at Walter Reed remain high, he said, but he acknowledged: ``The trust has taken a hit here.
3_13	0.06719052	And I think it's our job to repair that trust and to re-earn that trust.
3_14	0.084769649	And that's what we're going to do."
3_15	0.12098873	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, blasted the Army Wednesday, saying in a statement that it has known for years about shortcomings at Walter Reed.
3_16	0.10952932	``You could put all of the wounded soldiers in the Ritz-Carlton and it wouldn't fix the personnel, management and record-keeping problems that keep them languishing in outpatient limbo out there for months while paperwork from 11 disjointed systems gets shuffled and lost," Davis said.
3_17	0.094667744	Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., echoed Davis' concerns after she toured Building 18 and spoke to soldiers.
3_18	0.098081039	``The problem is much more serious than one building," she said in an interview.
3_19	0.098228404	``It's going to be easy for everyone to duck this problem after the building is fixed if we don't fix the completely dilapidated administrative system."
3_20	0.10382104	Norton said that she thinks Congress will have to compel the Army to overhaul its outpatient care system but that immediate steps are needed to help soldiers trapped in the existing bureaucracy.
3_21	0.11642402	Army Secretary Francis Harvey said an independent review group of about eight people will be established to look at outpatient care.
3_22	0.11085728	Winkenwerder said the group would report back to the Pentagon in a ``short time frame."
3_23	0.09735204	Cody called the state of Building 18 -- where 76 soldiers live -- ``inexcusable" and said he will ``personally oversee" its renovation.
3_24	0.097650831	He said the building had been upgraded several times and called the furniture ``very nice" but said the walls and infrastructure were not ``up to speed" and required inspections were not done or were not rigorous enough.
3_25	0.099892932	Harvey said the building would be renamed after a Army doctor, medic or nurse who was killed in action.
3_26	0.1020182	Cody said the Army will review all its procedures for handling wounded soldiers and their families, and would seek to streamline systems for assistance.

4_1	0.36465257	If you listen to the PR operation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the U.S. military's gleaming flagship hospital offers veterans the best treatment available.
4_2	0.10689431	What doesn't get mentioned is the bureaucratic contempt and physical squalor that too often await badly injured outpatient soldiers on the Walter Reed campus, the subject of a four-month Post investigation detailed in articles published Sunday and Monday.
4_3	0.18144717	Reporters Dana Priest and Anne Hull and researcher Julie Tate spent hundreds of hours inspecting conditions and interviewing injured troops and their loved ones at the Walter Reed outpatient facilities.
4_4	0.083898761	Their findings: Veterans' rooms are rank; bureaucratic hassles and paper-pushing make the process of repairing buildings, redressing patient grievances and providing veterans with basic goods depressingly inept; administrators' neglect of patients' mental and physical health borders on the criminal; and, most distressing, many veterans leave Walter Reed without the compensation they clearly deserve for their sacrifices.
4_5	0.095609218	The walls of one soldier's room were covered with black mold, and the ceiling of his shower had a large hole.
4_6	0.056980059	Soldiers who lost their uniforms while undergoing emergency treatment on the battlefield have had to present their purple hearts to get replacement clothes.
4_7	0.07796548	Amputees and patients on taxing drug regimens are required to report for formation early in the morning, even if it means trudging over accumulated ice and snow.
4_8	0.11548492	Lost paperwork, which in one case resulted in an obviously impaired veteran getting an order to report to Germany, is a constant problem, sometimes forcing soldiers and their relatives to live at Walter Reed for 18 months or longer as their cases are processed.
4_9	0.08990621	Most infuriating are reports of official efforts to deny disability benefits to discharged fighters.
4_10	0.084267092	The Army tried to deny disability compensation to Cpl. Dell McLeod, who suffered a head injury that left him aimless and unable even to count change at the cafeteria.
4_11	0.097064804	Army officials' argument: Because he had done poorly in high school, his current mental state might not have been caused by the steel door that smashed his skull in Iraq.
4_12	0.10119575	If the Army determined that he was mentally fit to serve in the first place, it cannot now abscond from its responsibility for the consequences of his service overseas.
4_13	0.10029025	Cpl. McLeod ended up getting a settlement from the command at Walter Reed -- despite base staffers' best efforts -- only after his wife got a congressional staffer involved.

4_15	0.096449103	His response is commendable, and it should not be forgotten that thousands of professionals and volunteers, civilian and military, are working hard to help veterans heal and adjust.
4_16	0.10351123	But it also should not have taken newspaper articles to bring change to outpatient conditions at Walter Reed.
4_17	0.10016386	And while filthy conditions at Building 18 are a temporary problem for these veterans, lowball settlements may leave soldiers and their families impoverished for life.

5_1	0.44165198	Defense Secretary Robert Gates says people found to have been responsible for allowing substandard living conditions for soldier outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington will be "held accountable," although so far no one in the Army chain of command has offered to resign.
5_2	0.28328716	Gates spoke to reporters after visiting the medical compound, whose reputation as a premier caregiver for soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan has taken a severe hit in the aftermath of a Washington Post series of reports last week that documented problems in soldiers' housing and in the medical bureaucracy at Walter Reed.
5_3	0.086198666	"A bedrock principle of our military system is that we empower commanders with the responsibility, authority and resources necessary to carry out their mission," Gates said.

6_18	0.13643105	Priest first contacted the Army on Monday, Feb. 12, and provided a list of 30 questions about conditions at Walter Reed.
6_19	0.11151073	She said Weightman was responsive during a two-hour interview Thursday, Feb. 15, but she initially thought he was joking when he said he would be briefing other news organizations on Walter Reed's problems the following day.
6_20	0.10159626	At the Friday briefing, reporters were told that Weightman's remarks were embargoed until late Saturday afternoon, around the time The Post's story was expected to be posted online.
6_21	0.091493899	That, said Baggio, was done as a ``courtesy."
6_22	0.090133683	After an internal debate, said Spiegel of the Los Angeles Times, ``it seemed to us pointless to try to cobble something together" without The Post's findings.
6_23	0.099800183	But the Army succeeded in putting its stamp on some stories.
6_24	0.14142546	An AP report Saturday evening began: ``The commander of the Army's leading medical facility acknowledges problems in outpatient treatment but said the hospital is working to address the concerns of patients and their families."
6_25	0.10457582	Spiegel's Times piece Sunday said Weightman ``has acknowledged that the staff responsible for tracking patients after they receive treatment was overwhelmed by the number of wounded when violence spiked in Iraq two years ago."
6_26	0.12184796	Both reports said Weightman spoke in advance of The Post's stories.
6_27	0.11511292	Army officials are now questioning the paper's handling of the probe.
6_28	0.10126224	In a letter to Walter Reed's staff this week, Weightman said that ``information for this article was covertly obtained over more than two years by reporters who did not wish to bring their findings to the leadership for action."
6_29	0.099824667	Priest, saying the inquiry lasted four months, not two years, declined to explain how she and Hull repeatedly signed into Walter Reed without the knowledge of the Army brass.
6_30	0.097444073	Every patient or family member quoted by name, she said, had agreed to be on the record.
6_31	0.10397912	``We never lied to anyone about who we were," Priest said.
6_32	0.09756936	``We just tried not to be in a position to identify ourselves to anyone who would report us to public affairs and have us kicked off the base."
6_33	0.097548694	As for Weightman's complaint that the paper should have notified the Army of its conclusions earlier in the process, Priest called that ``ridiculous," saying: ``You find wrongdoing and you don't report it to the public first?
6_34	0.0894524	You report it to them first?
6_35	0.091213408	That's not our role."

7_1	0.43765671	Defense Secretary Robert Gates named an independent review panel Friday to investigate what he called an ``unacceptable situation" in outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he said that some soldiers ``most directly involved" in the problems have been removed from their positions.
7_2	0.23458178	Speaking to reporters during a visit to the Army hospital in the District of Columbia, Gates also warned that senior military leaders could be disciplined based on the findings of the review group.
7_3	0.12948957	``We empower commanders with responsibility, authority and resources necessary to carry out their missions.
7_4	0.096399748	With responsibility comes accountability," Gates said.
7_5	0.26139539	``Accordingly, after the facts are established, those responsible for allowing this situation to develop will indeed be held accountable."
7_6	0.077700744	The Senate Armed Services Committee has tentatively scheduled hearings on the facility for March 6, said a spokeswoman for the panel's chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
7_7	0.11557011	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking minority member of the committee, toured the facility Friday.
7_8	0.17016952	The actions came after stories in the Washington Post last weekend that revealed that wounded soldiers recuperating at Walter Reed often become mired in red tape as they seek further treatment or decisions about whether they will stay in the military.
7_9	0.15566295	The articles also disclosed poor living conditions -- including mold, filth and leaks -- in Building 18, an Army facility housing recovering troops.
7_10	0.09062226	``I'm grateful to reporters for bringing this to our attention, but thoroughly disappointed we did not identify it ourselves," Gates said in his first public remarks addressing the situation.
7_11	0.19637277	The eight-member review group appointed by Gates has been charged with taking a broad look at all rehabilitative care and administrative procedures both at Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.
7_12	0.095320357	Panel members ``will be given free and unrestricted access" to visit medical facilities and interview personnel, Gates said.
7_13	0.15507899	The group will be co-chaired by Togo West, who was secretary of veterans affairs and secretary of the Army during the Clinton administration, and by John ``Jack" Marsh, who was secretary of the Army under President Reagan and a former member of Congress from Virginia.
7_14	0.10830193	Other members include two former members of Congress, three retired senior military officers and a retired command sergeant major.
7_15	0.10478527	Their report is due within 45 days and will be made public, Gates said.
7_16	0.12897441	Gates said he had no information suggesting there are problems at Bethesda similar to those at Walter Reed, but said the naval facility is being included because ``we need to know the scope of this problem."
7_17	0.099135978	There is rare unanimity in Washington on the need to treat wounded soldiers well, Gates said, ``and so we're determined to fix it, and fix it fast."
7_18	0.12440781	He described the medical care itself at the hospital as ``unsurpassable" and said the shortcomings were confined to ``the outpatient aspect of this."
7_19	0.11498925	During his visit, Gates met a group of five soldiers being treated at the facility who spoke of a frustrating administrative bureaucracy at the hospital.
7_20	0.095937219	``They battled our foreign enemies, they should not have to battle an American bureaucracy," Gates said.
7_21	0.10425304	Gates said caseworkers are ``overwhelmed" by the numbers of patients they are assigned, and he indicated more workers would be soon assigned to the hospital.
7_22	0.098489425	``There's just too much work for the number of people that are available," he said.
7_23	0.098155204	``So that's one thing that can be addressed pretty quickly."
7_24	0.09929909	Gates added that troops who had been wounded in service ``should not have to recuperate in substandard housing."
7_25	0.1038259	The Army declined to identify publicly the personnel who have been moved to different positions at the hospital.
7_26	0.12106231	Speaking on background, an Army official said they included several soldiers involved in supervising facilities at Walter Reed, including Building 18.
7_27	0.097604418	Gates met with President Bush Friday morning to brief him on the actions underway.
7_28	0.098921228	``He is, understandably, concerned and emphatic in wanting the best possible care for our wounded soldiers and for their families," Gates said.

8_1	0.31880227	The White House and congressional leaders called Tuesday for swift investigation and repair of the problems plaguing outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, as veterans groups and members of Congress in both parties expressed outrage over substandard housing and the slow, dysfunctional bureaucracy there.
8_2	0.34111057	Top Army officials Tuesday visited Building 18, the decrepit former hotel housing more than 80 recovering soldiers, outside the gates of the medical center.
8_3	0.15436392	Army Secretary Francis Harvey and Vice Chief of Staff Richard Cody toured the building and spoke to soldiers as workers in protective masks stripped mold from the walls and tore up soiled carpets.
8_4	0.20316606	At the White House, spokesman Tony Snow said he spoke with the president Tuesday about Walter Reed and the president told him: ``Find out what the problem is and fix it."
8_5	0.33552899	He said Bush ``first learned of the troubling allegations regarding Walter Reed from the stories this weekend in The Washington Post.
8_6	0.074415487	He is deeply concerned and wants any problems identified and fixed."
8_7	0.12881821	He said he did not know why the president, who has visited the facility many times in the past five years, had not heard about these problems before.
8_8	0.21412347	Walter Reed's commander, Maj. Gen. George Weightman, said in an interview that the Army leadership had assured him all the staff increases he had requested would be met.
8_9	0.090679771	``This is not an issue," he said.
8_10	0.079044584	``This is their number one priority."
8_11	0.10841484	He said the Army has agreed to fund what he called a ``surge plan" that has been designed for the likelihood that the 21,500-person troop increase now under way in Iraq will result in more casualties.
8_12	0.106354	Weightman said that case managers have been ordered to call each of the 700 outpatients to ask about problems they may be encountering.
8_13	0.10425265	He has also put half-dozen senior enlisted officers from the hospital in charge of the outpatients' companies normally in the hands of lower level platoon sergeants.
8_14	0.091611879	Also, a medic will now be stationed 24 hours a day at the Mologne House, the largest residence on the 113-acre post, to help soldiers with medical or psychological issues.
8_15	0.1459953	Harvey said he was surprised and disappointed at the conditions and the frustrating bureaucratic delays.
8_16	0.089625563	``In the warrior ethos the last line says you should never leave a fallen comrade, and from that facility point of view we didn't live up to it... and it looks to me we may have not lived up to it from a process side," he said, adding that conditions at the building are ``inexcusable."
8_17	0.087469876	``It's a failure... in the garrision leadership ... that should have never happened, and we are quickly going to rectify that situation," he said.
8_18	0.075788353	``We had some NCOs (noncommissioned officers) who weren't doing their job, period," Harvey said.
8_19	0.15124676	He said he and Cody would report regularly to Defense Secretary Robert Gates on an action plan to fix the conditions.
8_20	0.11107838	The Post series documented tattered conditions at Building 18, including mold, rot, mice and cockroaches, but also a larger bureaucratic indifference that has impeded some soldiers' ability to recover from their wounds.
8_21	0.094595319	At Building 18 Tuesday, platoon sergeants with clipboards went room-to-room inspecting for mold, leaks and other problems.
8_22	0.091867506	A broken elevator was repaired and snow and ice was cleared from the sidewalks.
8_23	0.191937	The secretaries of the Army and Navy announced they had begun a broader review of Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center and announced that an independent review group will be formed to investigate outpatient care and administrative processes.
8_24	0.1091548	Walter Reed is set to close in 2011 and the naval facility in Bethesda, Md., will be expanded to handle the additional wounded.
8_25	0.10046673	Walter Reed's fixes are unlikely to immediately quiet the drumbeat of criticism that erupted among members of Congress who received a flood of calls from the public and veterans groups asking how the problems could have been unknown to officials, some of whom visit Walter Reed on a regular basis.
8_26	0.10082935	``We need to bring the Army people in and say, `What the hell is going on?"' said Rep. Bob Filner, D-Cailf., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.
8_27	0.12684214	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asked the House Armed Services Committee to conduct an investigation of outpatient care at Walter Reed.
8_28	0.10226459	``The treatment reported in the Post of our troops and our veterans is disgraceful," said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly.
8_29	0.097478117	Several senators, including Democratic presidential candidate Barak Obama of Illinois and former presidential candidate John Kerry, D-Mass., announced they are co-sponsoring legislation to simplify the paperwork process for recovering soldiers and increase case managers and psychological counselors.

8_31	0.098839915	Jeff Miller, R-Fla., ranking member on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs subcommittee on health, said, ``the neglect being experienced by some wounded service members is outrageous.
8_32	0.097945634	The Defense Department is never shy about asking for supplemental funds for operations and equipment; I cannot imagine why housing for recuperating wounded would not be a similarly high priority."
8_33	0.10162816	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., former head of the House Government Reform Committee, urged the committee to hold a hearing at Walter Reed to give members an ``invaluable firsthand look" at how the Army is processing the wounded.

9_1	0.42910357	Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that he would move swiftly to improve conditions for wounded soldiers being treated as outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he warned that senior officials would be held accountable for the poor conditions.
9_2	0.27749374	Gates, speaking to reporters after touring the facilities and speaking to several patients, said he was upset by reports in The Washington Post describing wounded soldiers living in dilapidated buildings near the Walter Reed campus and portraying the massive paperwork and other bureaucratic hurdles they had to overcome during treatment.
9_3	0.16934769	Gates announced the creation of an eight-member commission to examine conditions at Walter Reed, on the outskirts of Washington, and other military hospitals, and make recommendations for improvements within 45 days.
9_4	0.24923552	"After the facts are established, those responsible for having allowed this unacceptable situation to develop will indeed be held responsible," Gates said.
9_5	0.2108758	As the number of service members wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan has climbed, Defense Department officials have held up Walter Reed as a facility offering unmatched care.
9_6	0.089759542	But the large number of patients there, currently about 650, has forced officials to rely on overflow facilities nearby more than they have in the past and has caused long waits for some treatments, officials acknowledged.
9_7	0.25073355	Pentagon officials have stressed that the quality of care at Walter Reed and other Army facilities is generally high.
9_8	0.11087997	They have said that the poor conditions, which included moldy walls, cockroaches, mouse droppings and stained carpets, were confined to a 54-room Army-owned facility across the street from the main Walter Reed campus where nearly 70 recovering service members are being housed.
9_9	0.097487657	But the Post reports prompted several days of damage control by Army and Pentagon officials that have veered back and forth between acknowledging the situation and playing it down.
9_10	0.1375572	The Army's top medical officer, Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, described the newspaper's account as a "one-sided representation" at a news conference Thursday, emphasizing that he was objecting to the tone of the stories, not the facts.
9_11	0.12105455	Only a day before, Gen. Richard Cody, the Army vice chief of staff, said: "We were absolutely disappointed in the status of the rooms and found the delays and lack of attention to detail to the building's repairs inexcusable."
9_12	0.12529221	The outpatients at Walter Reed have received initial treatment but require further care or rehabilitation before retiring from the armed forces or returning to active duty.
9_13	0.088762012	Gates said of the accounts in The Post: "I have not seen anything or heard anything" that led him believe the articles "were in any substantial way wrong."
9_14	0.10378261	He said no hospital officials had offered to resign but several lower-level employees overseeing outpatient care had been relieved on their duties.
9_15	0.09988531	He said he met earlier Friday with President Bush to discuss the situation.
9_16	0.097765859	Hospital officials in recent days have moved to clean up the most visible problems.
9_17	0.11982113	Gates said the new commission, to include retired officials from the Pentagon, Congress and the armed services, would also look at conditions at the National Naval Medical Center nearby in Bethesda, Md., and any other military medical facilities they choose to examine.
9_18	0.10120655	The members are Togo West, secretary of veterans affairs and secretary of the Army under President Bill Clinton; Jack Marsh, secretary of the Army under President Ronald Reagan; Dr. Joe Schwarz, a former Republican congressman from Michigan; Jim Bacchus, a former Democratic congressman from Florida; and four retired military officers, Gen. John Jumper, former Air Force chief of staff; Lt. Gen. Chip Roadman, former Air Force surgeon general; Rear Adm. Kathy Martin, former Navy deputy surgeon general; and Command Sgt. Maj. Larry Holland.
9_19	0.10716447	Gates said he was disappointed that the Defense Department did not uncover the problems itself.
9_20	0.10033639	The main Walter Reed hospital is scheduled to close by 2011.
9_21	0.10555012	Its operations are to be transferred to the Bethesda facility, which will be expanded and renamed the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
