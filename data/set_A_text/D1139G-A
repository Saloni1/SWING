2_0	0.25508882	1st LD: Somali pirates hijack Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker
2_1	0.52918242	Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker, the largest vessel ever seized, loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, a regional maritime official said on Monday.
2_2	0.30780057	Andrew Mwangura, the East African Coordinator of the Seafarers Assistance Program, said the oil tanker is the largest ship pirates have hijacked along the east Africa coast.
2_3	0.3061051	"It seems the vessel was hijacked on Saturday because the ship is approaching anchorage off the port of Eyl in Somalia.
2_4	0.071339155	For it to reach there, it must have taken three to four days," Mwangura told Xinhua by telephone.
2_5	0.27236351	Reports from the U.S. Navy said the tanker, Sirius Star, operated by Vela International, was hijacked after a group of pirates managed to scale the 10-meter high side of the ship.
2_6	0.16538472	Lieutenant Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet said the hijacking was shocking because it highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom- hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year off Somalia.
2_7	0.16078777	The U.S. Navy said the Saturday's hijacking of the oil tanker occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel, which leads to and from the Suez Canal.
3_0	0.26316123	NATO is considering whether to launch long-term missions to counter piracy, a spokesman said Tuesday, as pirates anchored a captured Saudi super-tanker off the coast of Somalia.
3_1	0.084194671	"There will be a second discussion in NATO referring to a potential longer-term role" in anti-piracy operations, spokesman James Appathurai told reporters in Brussels.
3_2	0.14298149	NATO has four ships -- from Britain, Greece, Italy and Turkey -- on patrol in the waters off Somalia, with two protecting UN food aid convoys to the strife- torn Horn of Africa country.
3_3	0.063394259	The mission, NATO's first-ever against pirates and which is commanded from Naples, southern Italy, ends in mid-December when the bigger European Union Operation Atalanta is to be put in place.
3_4	0.068490554	"The EU presence will be bigger and more designed for the mission," Appathurai said, but he added that the military alliance is wondering "would anything complementary be necessary" for the EU.
3_5	0.21078618	He added that NATO played no role in response to the seizure of the oil-laden Saudi tanker, the Sirius Star, which was taken at the weekend in waters off the coast of Kenya and Tanzania.
3_6	0.18288222	On Tuesday, the super-tanker, carrying 100 million dollars of oil, was anchored off the Somali piracy hub port of Haradhere.
3_7	0.10861508	"We are not in the area," the spokesman said.
3_8	0.11083139	"This happened thousands of miles away from the place where the NATO operation is supposed to take place."
3_9	0.22200817	According to the US navy, the tanker -- which is as big as three soccer fields -- is the largest ship ever seized by pirates and the hijacking was the farthest out to sea Somali bandits have attacked a vessel.
3_10	0.22816114	Experts say the attack shows few ships are safe sailing the Indian Ocean.
3_11	0.098827521	Appathurai noted that NATO had escorted around 7,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Somalia since its operation began this month, and cited the UN World Food Programme as saying that no pirate attacks had hit its ships since.
3_12	0.09702486	The WFP ships 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes of aid into Somalia each month.

4_1	0.7805065	Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil supertanker loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.
4_2	0.61310617	It was the largest ship pirates have seized, and the farthest out to sea they have successfully struck.
4_3	0.42835929	The hijacking was alarming because it highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom-hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year off Somalia.
4_4	0.61923891	Saturday's hijacking of the MV Sirius Star tanker occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel, which leads to and from the Suez Canal.
4_5	0.26192076	Maritime security experts said they have tracked a troubling spread in pirate activity southward into a vast area of ocean that would be extremely difficult and costly to patrol, and this hijacking fits that pattern.
4_6	0.41037495	"It is very alarming," said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.
4_7	0.27854597	"It had been slightly more easy to get it under control in the Gulf of Aden because it is a comparatively smaller area of water which has to be patrolled, but this is huge."
4_8	0.50989362	The tanker, which is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is one of the largest ships to sail the seas.
4_9	0.34862909	It is 330 meters (1,080 feet) long, or about the length of an aircraft carrier, and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.

4_12	0.29465362	He said the bandits were taking it to an anchorage off the Somali port of Eyl.
4_13	0.30101736	The port on Somalia's northeastern coast has become a pirate haven and a number of ships are already being held there as pirates try to force ransoms.
4_14	0.59294054	The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
4_15	0.42762803	A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals aboard the vessel.
4_16	0.39230532	The Sirius Star was attacked more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the U.S. 5th Fleet said in a statement from its Middle East headquarters in Bahrain.
4_17	0.37642766	"It's the largest ship we've seen hijacked and one attacked farthest out on the sea," Christensen said.
4_18	0.33167548	The capturing of the oil tanker represents a "fundamental shift in the ability of pirates to be able to attack merchant vessels," he said.
4_19	0.27825374	The Sirius Star was built in South Korea's Daewoo shipping yards and commissioned in March.
4_20	0.38458261	Classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the ship is 318,000 dead weight tons.
4_21	0.12267301	If it were fully loaded, the ship's deck would be lower to the water, making it easier for pirates to climb aboard with grappling equipment and ladders, as they do in most hijackings.
4_22	0.13949959	It is not clear if there was a security team on board the vessel.
4_23	0.25246352	An operator with Aramco said there was no one available at the company to comment after business hours.

4_25	0.20052473	Somali pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and GPS equipment.
4_26	0.16194913	They are typically armed with automatic weapons, anti- tank rockets launchers and various types of grenades.
4_27	0.18641374	As pirates have become better armed and equipped, they have sailed farther out to sea in search of bigger targets, including oil tankers, among the 20,000 tankers, freighters and merchant vessels transiting the Gulf of Aden each year.
4_28	0.14321343	Attacks have increased more than 75 percent this year.
4_29	0.15474263	With most attacks ending with million-dollar payouts, piracy is considered the biggest economy in Somalia.
4_30	0.088503945	Pirates rarely hurt their hostages, instead holding out for a huge payday.
4_31	0.1362833	The strategy works well: A report last month by a London-based think tank said pirates have raked in up to $30 million in ransoms this year alone.
4_32	0.10101022	In Somalia, pirates are better-funded, better-organized and better-armed than one might imagine in a country that has been in tatters for nearly two decades.
4_33	0.093116695	They do occasionally get nabbed, however.
4_34	0.09846811	Earlier this year, French commandos used night vision goggles and helicopters in operations that killed or captured several pirates, who are now standing trial in Paris.
4_35	0.097909512	The stepped-up international presence recently also appears to have deterred several attacks.
4_36	0.10051091	Raja Kiwan, a Dubai-based analyst with PFC Energy, said the hijacking raises "some serious questions" about what is needed to secure such ships when they are on the open seas.
4_37	0.10817956	"It's not easy to take over a ship" as massive as an oil tanker, particularly VLCC's that can transport about 2 million barrels of crude, he said.
4_38	0.10781647	He said such vessels typically have an armed security contingent on board but could not say if that was the case with the Sirius Star.
4_39	0.12282408	Pirates have gone after oil tankers before.
4_40	0.10161341	In October, a Spanish military patrol plane thwarted pirates trying to hijack an oil tanker by buzzing them three times and dropping smoke canisters.
4_41	0.097811901	On April 21, pirates fired rocket-propelled grenades at a Japanese oil tanker, leaving a hole that allowed several hundred gallons of fuel to leak out, raising fears for the environment.
4_42	0.10095162	In September, three pirates in a speed boat fired machine guns at an Iranian crude oil carrier, though the ship escaped after a 30-minute chase.
4_43	0.10461295	Warships from the more than a dozen nations as well as NATO forces have focused their anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden, increasing their military presence in recent months.
4_44	0.10401797	But Saturday's hijacking occurred much farther south, highlighting weaknesses in the international response to the problem.
4_45	0.10338173	"The coalition has suppressed a number of attacks... but there will never be enough warships," said Graeme Gibbon Brooks, the managing director of British company Dryad Maritime Intelligence Service Ltd.
4_46	0.10813661	"The whole area is 2.5 million square miles (6.5 million square kilometers)... the coalition have to act preemptively and be one step ahead of the pirates.
4_47	0.10673391	The difficulty here is that the ship was beyond the area where the coalition were currently acting."
4_48	0.10077826	Associated Press writers Katharine Houreld and Elizabeth A. Kennedy in Nairobi, Kenya, and Jason Keyser and Tarek el-Tablawy in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this report.
5_0	0.50933066	A hijacked Saudi-owned supertanker carrying more than $100 million worth of crude oil was anchored off the coast of Somalia on Tuesday, and the ship's owner said it was working to free the ship and its 25-member crew.
5_1	0.38301756	The owner, Vela International, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia- based oil giant Saudi Aramco, said in a statement that the company was awaiting further contact from the pirates who seized the vessel about 480 miles off the coast of Somalia.
5_2	0.4035487	Earlier reports had said that the 1,080-foot-long ship, Sirius Star, had been hijacked off the Kenyan coast.
5_3	0.15674435	The company did not say specifically that it had begun negotiations with the hijackers.
5_4	0.29026457	The supertanker, about the same length as an American Nimitz class aircraft carrier, is the largest ship known to have been seized by pirates, and it was fully loaded with 2 million barrels of oil.

5_7	0.19671273	Lt. Nathan Christensen, deputy spokesman for the U.S. 5th Fleet, said that the tanker had been anchored within sight of the coastal town of Xarardheere.
5_8	0.12482301	The town is 260 miles north of Mogadishu, the Somali capital, and is part of the breakaway Puntland region, which is known as a hub of pirate activity.
5_9	0.1611224	The hijacking follows a string of increasingly brazen attacks by Somali pirates in recent months, but this appeared to be first time they have seized an oil tanker.
5_10	0.1432189	While most of the hijackings have taken place in the Gulf of Aden, which separates Somalia from Yemen, the Saudi tanker was seized hundreds of miles to the south in a vast stretch of open ocean as the tanker headed toward the Cape of Good Hope.
5_11	0.10542083	The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, called the hijacking "an outrageous act."
5_12	0.099530554	In Athens, Greece, on Tuesday, he said, "Piracy, like terrorism, is a disease which is against everybody, and everybody must address it together."

6_1	0.40163247	In a dramatic escalation of high seas crime, Somali pirates hijacked a Saudi supertanker loaded with crude oil hundreds of miles (kilometers) off the coast of East Africa -- defeating the security web of warships trying to protect vital shipping lanes.
6_2	0.13291731	The takeover demonstrates the bandits' heightened ambitions and capabilities: Never before have they seized such a giant ship so far out to sea.
6_3	0.34215022	Maritime experts warned that the broad daylight attack, reported by the U.S. Navy on Monday, was an alarming sign of the difficulty of patrolling a vast stretch of ocean key to oil and other cargo traffic.
6_4	0.36622263	The MV Sirius Star, a brand new tanker with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 a.m.
6_5	0.48775465	Saturday more than 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the Navy said.
6_6	0.42111854	The area lies far south of the zone where warships have increased their patrols this year in the Gulf of Aden, one of the busiest channels in the world, leading to and from the Suez Canal, and the scene of most past attacks.
6_7	0.21872875	"We are very concerned that a (ship) of this size has been hijacked.

6_14	0.1084483	But experts said its crew may have felt a false sense of security so far from shore, even though pirates have repeatedly demonstrated their skill in taking down big prizes.
6_15	0.16178414	Details of Saturday's attack were not known, but in past seizures, pirates have used ropes and ladders to climb the hull -- and on large ships, the crew often does not notice them until it is too late.

6_18	0.14699227	In past attacks, alert crews have fended off pirates trying to climb the sides, using water hoses to knock them away.

8_1	0.34470082	Somali pirates hijacked a giant Saudi supertanker with a cargo of crude oil hundreds of miles out in the Indian Ocean in a dramatic escalation that showed their expanding reach, puncturing a security web of warships trying to protect vital shipping lanes.
8_2	0.36805339	It was the largest vessel seized yet in a surge of pirate attacks, and the farthest out to sea that the well-armed fighters, bolstered by millions in past ransoms, have successfully struck.
8_3	0.3385732	Maritime experts warned that the broad daylight attack, reported by the U.S. Navy on Monday, was an alarming sign of the difficulty of patrolling a vast stretch of ocean key for oil and other cargo traffic.
8_4	0.36984704	The brand new MV Sirius Star tanker, with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 a.m.
8_5	0.66389382	Saturday more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the U.S. Navy said.
8_6	0.41304687	The area lies far south of the zone where warships have increased their patrols this year in the Gulf of Aden, one of the busiest channels in the world, leading to and from the Suez Canal, and the scene of most past attacks.
8_7	0.21866728	The massive supertanker would seem to present a daunting target for the pirates, who usually operate in small speedboats.
8_8	0.38102086	At 330 meters (1,080 feet), it's the length of an aircraft carrier, able to carry about 2 million barrels of oil.
8_9	0.1155639	But its crew may have had a false sense of security so far from shore, and pirates have repeatedly demonstrated their skill in taking down big prizes.
8_10	0.17472598	Details of Saturday's attack were not known, but in past seizures, pirates have used ropes and ladders to climb the hull -- and often on large ships, the crew don't notice them until it's too late.
8_11	0.21599252	On the Sirius Star, the attackers likely would have had to scale about 10 meters (33 feet) from the water to the deck.
8_12	0.30945516	It was not clear if the Sirius Star had any armed security on board.
8_13	0.15923745	In past attacks, alert crews have been able to fend off pirates trying to climb the sides, using water hoses to knock them away.
8_14	0.17143351	But the pirates are able to strike back: In April, they punched a hole in the side of a Japanese oil tanker with a rocket-propelled grenade in an unsuccessful attempt to capture it.
8_15	0.30207777	Pirates have been spreading their attacks in recent weeks southward into a vast area of the Indian Ocean that would be extremely difficult and costly to patrol, maritime security experts said.
8_16	0.2637803	"It had been slightly more easy to get it under control in the Gulf of Aden because it is a comparatively smaller area of water which has to be patrolled, but this is huge," said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.
8_17	0.46902284	The pirates were taking the captured tanker and crew to an anchorage off the Somali port of Eyl, Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said.
8_18	0.28748828	The port on Somalia's northeastern coast has become a pirate haven and a number of ships are already being held there as pirates negotiate ransoms.
8_19	0.39878299	Christensen said the Sirius Star was carrying crude, but could not say how much.
8_20	0.25731252	Fully loaded, the ship's cargo could be worth about $100 million.
8_21	0.12449888	But the pirates would have no way of selling crude and no way to refine it in Somalia.
8_22	0.11897539	Instead, they were likely to demand a ransom, as they have in the past.
8_23	0.31948505	"It's the largest ship we've seen hijacked and one attacked farthest out on the sea," Christensen said.
8_24	0.31756394	The capturing of the oil tanker represents a "fundamental shift in the ability of pirates to be able to attack merchant vessels."
8_25	0.27980072	The Sirius Star, which was commissioned in March and is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the second largest classification.
8_26	0.36884579	It was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
8_27	0.28917493	A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals on board.

8_31	0.22589841	Pirate attacks off Somalia have surged more than 75 percent this year, hitting freighters, tankers, yachts and fishing vessels.
8_32	0.12951974	The pirates raised international alarm bells in September when they seized a Ukrainian freighter, the Faina, carrying a cargo of battle tanks and other weapons.
8_33	0.11016969	The Faina and its 20-member crew are still being held off Somalia, watched by warships to prevent the removal of its cargo.
8_34	0.12661028	With most attacks ending with million-dollar payouts, piracy is considered the biggest economy in Somalia, a country that has had no stable government for decades.
8_35	0.14354967	A report last month by a London-based think tank said pirates have raked in up to $30 million in ransoms this year alone.
8_36	0.13966068	The pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and GPS equipment.

9_9	0.3221921	The Saudi tanker, however, was seized far to the south of the patrolled zone, about 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, according the U.S. Navy.
9_10	0.16799076	Maritime security experts said they have tracked a southward spread in piracy over the last several weeks into a vast area of the Indian Ocean, noting with alarm that the area would be almost impossible to patrol.
9_11	0.17090165	The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday it was monitoring the situation but didn't expect to send warships to surround the vessel as it has done with a Ukrainian ship loaded with tanks and other weaponry the was seized off the Somali coast on Sept. 25 and remains in pirate hands.
9_12	0.18579524	"I don't anticipate any U.S. ships on station," said Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the 5th Fleet, speaking from its headquarters in Bahrain.
9_13	0.12559391	He would not elaborate on how the Navy was watching the hijacked tanker.
9_14	0.14657431	"We remain deeply concerned because this attack represents a fundamental change in pirates' ability to hijack bigger vessels farther out at sea," Christensen said.
9_15	0.24807172	The Sirius Star is the largest ship ever taken by Somali pirates, though large chemical tankers and freighters have also been hijacked.
