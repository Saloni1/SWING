0_0	0.3181818181818182	Italy's TV channels broadcast twice as many commercials featuring food as their US counterparts, threatening children who watch them with serious eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia, according to a study published here Tuesday.
0_1	0.0	Children star in one out of every three commercials on Italian television, and 40 percent of all ads sell food products, according to the study by Rome's Sapienza university.
0_2	0.0	Psychologist Maria D'Alessio said her study "shows the threat caused by commercials aimed at children and featuring foodstuffs, because it distorts one's natural relationship with food".
0_3	0.0	"In the coming years, we will certainly have to face the problem of anorexia and bulimia," in Italian children.
0_4	0.0	D'Alessio said 40 commercials in every hour of programming were dedicated to food.
0_5	0.2	"In the long term, this is very damaging for children."
0_6	0.0	The study -- based on two weeks of programming in March 2004 on Italy's six main private and state-owned chanels -- also confirmed that ads aimed at children encourge stereotyping.
0_7	0.0	"Boys starring with their mothers are shown eating, while girls watch their mothers do the housework."
1_0	0.0	Mention anorexia and images of young women immediately come to mind: Mary Kate Olsen, Tracy Gold, Jamie Lynn Discalia.
1_1	0.0	Not Bradlea Hecht.
1_2	0.0	She's 57, married, a mother of two.
1_3	0.0	She's certainly not on a quest to look like an A-list actress or pop star.
1_4	0.0	But she is anorexic and has suffered from the disease, and bulimia, on and off since she was 14.
1_5	0.0	Years of claiming she wasn't hungry, eating small meals such as an apple and a salad, running errands or taking a walk while her co-workers went to lunch or purging when she ate more than made her comfortable were all part of Hecht's routine.
1_6	0.0	"It's no longer about control or the desire to be skinny," says Hecht.
1_7	0.0	"Now it is a matter of shedding an ingrained habit."
1_8	0.5	Medical professionals say they see more and more adult women like Hecht -- that is, those older than college age -- suffering from eating disorders.
1_9	0.0	Men, too, are being diagnosed as bulimic or anorexic at an increasing rate, says Dr. Sharon Alger-Mayer, who works in the division of clinical nutrition at Albany Medical Center Hospital.
1_10	0.0	As recently as 10 years ago it was a 1-to-10 male-to-female ratio.
1_11	0.0	Today it is 1-to-6.
1_12	0.25	According to research done by The Renfrew Center in Philadelphia, the country's first free-standing and largest treatment facility for eating disorders, the age distribution has changed: 23.5 percent of the women treated at Renfrew are now over 35.
1_13	0.16666666666666666	And the toll of the disease, which is defined as a mental illness, goes beyond the emotional and physical effects felt by one person.
1_14	0.75	"When a person has an eating disorder, it becomes a family problem," Hecht says.
1_15	0.0	"Because it affects you and all your loved ones."
1_16	0.6	Hecht says she doesn't talk about her eating disorder with her children, but she knows they love her and want her to stop.
1_17	0.0	Her husband was her caretaker when her health got so bad she couldn't walk herself to the bathroom.
1_18	0.0	Eventually she was admitted to an inpatient treatment facility.
1_19	0.0	While media images continue to create cultural definitions of beauty associated with thinness, middle-aged women often experience other stress-inducing problems, such as separation or divorce, empty-nest syndrome and physical changes associated with their age, says Alger-Mayer.
1_20	0.0	"These are triggers for some women to get reacquainted with an eating pattern or coping style that worked for them while in college," says Alger-Mayer.
1_21	0.0	Television shows such as "The Swan" or "Extreme Makeover" equate thinness and beauty with happiness.
1_22	0.0	Plus people can't go through a typical day without hearing about the Atkins or South Beach diets.
1_23	0.75	These factors can act as reminders and cause the eating disorder to resurface.
1_24	0.5454545454545454	For Hecht, the eating disorders were part of her life for many years, but she didn't admit it to herself, and others, until the mid-1990s.
1_25	0.0	"I was very secretive and ashamed.
1_26	0.0	I would say 'I just don't like to eat,"' she says.
1_27	0.0	"Lying goes with the illness, until you are ready to stop denying that you are ill."
1_28	0.0	And the shame can by magnified for older people, says Tully.
1_29	0.375	"Women can feel shameful because many of the behaviors -- like the binging and purging chewing and spitting out and over-exercising -- are not understood," says Tully, who sees several adults with eating disorders each week.
1_30	0.0	"People fear they will be judged or that what they are doing could possibly be a childish thing."
1_31	0.3684210526315789	While the reasons for adult eating disorders vary widely, a majority of sufferers, if not previously anorexic or bulimic, have dealt with weight issues at some point in their lives, says Alger-Mayer.
1_32	0.0	In many cases, it's about continuing control, as is the case with
1_33	0.0	Albany's Rebecca Walker.
1_34	0.0	The 29-year-old started restricting her food consumption and exercising excessively while a freshman in college.

1_36	0.0	"Then I went to college to play basketball and that, along with (academics), became overwhelming."
1_37	0.0	It became clear, she says, that she wasn't going to be able to achieve the way she had in high school.
1_38	0.0	"I don't think I learned what I really enjoyed, I just performed.
1_39	0.0	I didn't see choices, I saw expectations."
1_40	0.0	The stress led her to control the one thing she could -- her body.
1_41	0.0	She could choose, or limit, what she ate and exercise often.
1_42	0.0	Today, anorexia is a part of her life, almost a routine.
1_43	0.0	"Especially as an adult, you know you are a smart person, and intellectually it is the dumbest thing," says Walker.
1_44	0.0	"Maybe I have been successful in other ways, but I always feel I am not measuring up."
1_45	0.0	Both Hecht and Walker are medically underweight but, as part of ongoing therapy, prefer not to discuss numbers.
1_46	0.30434782608695654	Each has already suffered some of the permanent effects associated with the disease -- which can include weakened hearts, severe osteoporosis, teeth that break easily, brittle bones, loss of stamina and, most likely, a shortened life span, doctors say.
1_47	0.0	"I am 57, but I have a body that is 75 or 80," Hecht says.
1_48	0.0	Most significantly, she says, the disease rules her social life.
1_49	0.0	She does not eat in restaurants or at other people's homes, unless it can't be avoided.
1_50	0.0	She'd rather be home with her "safe foods," including grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs or tuna in water.
1_51	0.0	As each day goes by, full recovery becomes less and less likely for these women, and others like them, experts say.
1_52	0.0	"Older sufferers build a strong identity around this," Tully says.
1_53	0.0	"To ask them to seek recovery, or make changes, is like whipping away a security blanket."
2_0	0.0	Her gnarled knuckles, marred with cracked skin, made Amanda Meador's hands look more like those of a seasoned car mechanic than of a 17-year-old.
2_1	0.0	But the damage didn't come from turning wrenches in tight quarters under the hood of a car.
2_2	0.0	It came from shoving her fingers down her throat six to 10 times a day.
2_3	0.0	The gag reflex caused her teeth to clamp down as she yanked her hand out, biting into her fingers as she vomited.
2_4	0.0	Purging that many times a day caused Amanda to lose 60 pounds in about a year's time.
2_5	0.0	It almost caused her death.
2_6	0.0	Following Christmas break during her senior year in high school, she was hospitalized for dehydration, low blood pressure and low blood sugar.

2_15	0.0	Montaner, who thought the weight loss was from rigorous exercise and reduced food portions, was just glad her daughter was looking better.
2_16	0.0	The teen kept purging until she was caught by her brother, who told their mother.

2_22	0.07142857142857142	Montaner said she sat in horror as her daughter detailed how easy it was to eat between classes at school, then go to the bathroom after class started and force herself to vomit.
2_23	0.42857142857142855	Soon after, Montaner learned that Amanda had also begun self-mutilation by cutting herself, a behavioral step not uncommon in people with eating disorders, according to experts.
2_24	0.0	That was more than six years go.
2_25	0.0	Amanda Meador, now Amanda Harsh, is married, has two children, and lives in Savannah, Ga.
2_26	0.0	She's eating right and healthy, Montaner said, but the recovery process has been fraught with frustration, expensive therapy and a relapse after the children were born.
2_27	0.5454545454545454	When Montaner looked for help, she found that at the time, Waco did not have a specialist in eating disorder therapy.

2_36	0.35294117647058826	Montaner established the nonprofit Lifelines Foundation for Eating Disorders with the goal of establishing the first acute-care facility in Texas dedicated solely to treating eating disorders.
2_37	0.0	She plans on calling it "The Haven."

4_25	0.0625	Similarly, Walsh said, "we have people who are obese and binge but don't vomit," so they don't fit into the strict definition of bulimia nervosa, which requires both binging and purging.

4_38	0.38095238095238093	The "provisional" designation highlights the need for more research into a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge eating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a separate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.

4_41	0.10526315789473684	"If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there for which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not Otherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment, hindering research," he said.
4_42	0.32	Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a condition that has been labeled "purging disorder" by Dr. Pamela Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.
4_43	1.125	Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of bulimia, so does purging disorder.
4_44	0.16666666666666666	But neither meets the strict criteria for bulimia nervosa.
4_45	0.16666666666666666	People with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and they purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.
4_46	0.0	Right now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS category.
4_47	0.6666666666666666	And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists ask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much more will be known, Keel said.
4_48	0.08333333333333333	"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had a low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer skips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or diuretics to control weight," Keel wrote in an e-mail message.

4_52	0.15384615384615385	As First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is pulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a stand-alone diagnosis.
4_53	0.6153846153846154	These criteria have to be met before binge eating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out of the EDNOS grab bag.
4_54	0.0	The first requirement is that a significant number of patients must be affected, he said.
4_55	0.2	Second, there has to be evidence of an existing and effective treatment.
4_56	0.1	The criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions from being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
4_57	0.0	In the 1980s, there was an effort to include "sadistic personality disorder."
4_58	0.0	But it failed, said First, because no treatment existed.
4_59	0.0	"We could have decided to call something sadistic personality disorder," he said, "but if there's no treatment, what would be the point?"
4_60	0.18181818181818182	The third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise Specified category is the trickiest to meet.
4_61	0.0	It relates to a kind of diagnosis-creep.
4_62	0.0	Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be considered normal.
4_63	0.5714285714285714	For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must ask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is it the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every Thanksgiving?
4_64	0.0	"This is the matter of what we call false positives," First said.
4_65	0.0	"It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of symptoms that normal people have."
4_66	0.0	When a new category is created in the manual, he said, "you're trying to identify a category that will help patients get treatment."
4_67	0.0	"But," he continued, "you're worried that this category is going to be applied to normal people as well."
4_68	0.5	Some psychiatrists want to create a different label for EDNOS, calling it instead "mixed eating disorder" or "atypical eating disorder."
4_69	0.0	But Walsh of Columbia said that would be merely a cosmetic change.
4_70	0.20689655172413793	"If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've got a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if I'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds," he said.
4_71	0.0	"The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on their ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively homogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability to shortcut a full assessment."
4_72	0.0	Diagnostic labels, said Walsh, "allow big shortcuts."
4_73	0.75	Keel, on the other hand, prefers the term "mixed eating disorder" over EDNOS.
4_74	0.375	She said the mixed eating disorder label "may have the benefit of eliminating the false impression that EDNOS is somehow less severe or less clinically significant than so-called full-threshold eating disorders."
4_75	0.0	But she expressed concern that the term would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other identifiable conditions lie within the EDNOS category.
4_76	0.0	As experts debate what to do about EDNOS -- pull out distinct disorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria for the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more scientific-sounding name -- people with disordered eating are left in a kind of therapeutic limbo.
4_77	0.07692307692307693	Eventually, the hope is, the uncertainties will be resolved, and the woman with anorexia who still menstruates and the woman with bulimia who only purges once a week, will be able to get the diagnosis and treatment that they need.

8_2	0.15384615384615385	The temptation to overeat will strike most of us during the holiday season, but for those who suffer from a binge-eating disorder, holiday feasting can be self-inflicted hell.
8_3	0.9	Binge eating disorder is a newly recognized condition that probably affects millions of Americans.
8_4	0.09090909090909091	Those with the disorder frequently eat large amounts of food while feeling at a loss to control their eating.
8_5	0.125	To date, there are no approved medications to treat binge-eating disorder, but a large, multi-center study may offer hope to the 2 percent of the population who suffer from it.
8_6	0.08333333333333333	Dr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant professor of psychiatry of the University of Florida's College of Medicine, is among the researchers testing the effectiveness of topiramate, a drug developed to treat the convulsions and seizures of epilepsy, in controlling binge eating.
8_7	0.0	Shapira said that when topiramate was used for epilepsy patients, many reported that they also had a marked decrease in appetite and even lost weight.
8_8	0.5333333333333333	A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating disorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a placebo binged less often and also lost weight.
8_9	0.0	The new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge eaters from around the country, Shapira said.
8_10	0.0	Results are anticipated next year.
8_11	0.0	It is funded by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, which makes the drug.
8_12	0.6153846153846154	Binge eating disorder, Shapira emphasizes, is not the same as indulging in an occasional binge at the table or "grazing" through an array of buffet offerings.
8_13	0.0	"Everyone probably binges at some point, particularly during 'sanctioned' events like Thanksgiving dinner," Shapira said.
8_14	0.35714285714285715	"The real difference between 'grazing' and binge eating is eating much more than normal in a short period of time, often less than two hours.
8_15	0.0	"It's a terrible situation to be surrounded by food when that's all that you are thinking about," he said.
8_16	0.0	After a binge, he said, binge eaters feel disgusted with themselves.
8_17	0.0	As a result, they often eat alone or very rapidly, and will eat until they are uncomfortably full.
8_18	0.5333333333333333	Unlike eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa or anorexia where victims are predominantly female, the ratio of female to male binge eaters is about 3-to-2.
8_19	0.0	It is common in all ethnic groups.
8_20	1.0	Almost all who have this disorder are either overweight or obese.
8_21	0.25	It has been estimated that up to 30 percent of those in weight-loss programs have a binge-eating disorder.
8_22	0.0	They usually develop a weight problem earlier in life and do not do as well in these programs.
8_23	0.6666666666666666	One study looking at Overeaters Anonymous found that 70 percent of the members had a binge eating disorder, Shapira said.
8_24	0.8888888888888888	The major complications of binge eating disorder are the diseases that accompany obesity.
8_25	0.15384615384615385	These include diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, gallbladder disease, heart disease and certain types of cancer.
8_26	0.7272727272727273	The causes of the disorder are still unknown, but up to half of all people with binge eating disorder have a history of depression.
8_27	0.0	Whether depression is a cause or effect is unclear, according to the National Institutes of Health.
8_28	0.0	Many people report that anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety or other negative emotions can trigger a binge episode.
8_29	0.0	"There's a lack of recognition that this disorder is very common and treatable," Shapira said.
8_30	0.07692307692307693	For those who think they might have an eating problem, he suggests two questions: Do you eat a lot of food in a short period?
8_31	0.0	Do you feel out of control as you do so?
8_32	0.3333333333333333	Those who answer "yes" to both should consider whether they have a binge-eating disorder.

9_0	0.3333333333333333	An appetite-curbing hormone that failed to live up to its early buzz as a possible key to slowing obesity is now being probed as a potential aid for women who suffer from infertility and eating disorders.
9_1	0.0	"This represents essentially a new era for leptin," said Dr. Jean Chan, one of the researchers exploring new uses for the hormone.
9_2	0.0	"Now that we understand so much more about what this hormone does, we can target it appropriately for the right condition."
9_3	0.0	A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.
9_4	0.0	Authors of the study also said there were some preliminary signs that the hormone improved bone density, which begins to decline when women stop menstruating.
9_5	0.42857142857142855	Women with low body fat, including athletes and those with eating disorders, often stop menstruating, developing a condition called hypothalamic amenorrhea.
9_6	0.0	The condition, caused by the way the brain regulates the reproductive system, can also affect some women who are overly thin.
9_7	0.0	Doctors believe some of those cases are caused by stress.
9_8	0.0	But in others, they believe it may be caused by subtler changes in body composition caused by diet and exercise.
9_9	0.0	The new work on leptin may offer clues to the condition's cause.
9_10	0.0	One function of leptin, which was discovered in 1994, is to regulate appetite.
9_11	0.0	It was originally thought that increasing leptin might suppress the appetites of obese people.
9_12	0.0	But studies found heavy people tended to have plenty of leptin and adding more didn't help.
9_13	0.0	Researchers in the new study, which was funded by institutional grants and Amgen, the developer of a drug based on the hormone, began looking at people who may not have enough leptin because of low body fat.
9_14	0.0	The researchers gave injections of Amgen's synthetic leptin to eight competitive women athletes, all with hypothalamic amenorrhea.
9_15	0.0	The injections raised the women's leptin levels to those of normal women or higher.
9_16	0.0	Treatment was given until they responded or up to three months, whichever came first.
9_17	0.0	(One woman dropped out of the study.)
9_18	0.0	Five of the remaining seven showed promising results, according to the study.
9_19	0.0	Three of the women, one of whom had not had a period in 14 years, ovulated and had menstrual bleeding.
9_20	0.0	Two others were "for all intents and purposes about to ovulate," Chan said.
9_21	0.0	Researchers said they envisioned possible fertility treatments, help for thin athletes at risk of bone fractures, and restoration of menstruation to patients recovering from anorexia.
9_22	0.0	Dr. Barbara Corkey, president of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity and a professor of medicine and biochemistry at Boston University, said the study had found a "creative use of leptin," but she wasn't surprised.
9_23	0.0	"Leptin doesn't have only one function," she said.
9_24	0.0	"It serves another function and this highlights that."
9_25	0.0	Dr. William Schlaff, president of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility and a professor at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, said the study was "very nicely designed" and had made an "important first observation" that needed further study.
9_26	0.0	Ultimately, he speculated, it could lead to advances that would help infertile women.
9_27	0.0	Dr. Rexford Ahima, at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine's Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, said the study suggested that leptin is the signal that links fat tissue to the brain and instructs it to control menstruation.
9_28	0.0	Ahima agreed that leptin might have potential as a fertility treatment.
9_29	0.5	But he had questions about its use as a treatment for eating disorders, noting that anorexia is primarily a psychiatric disorder whose root cause should be addressed before leptin is considered.
9_30	0.0	Chan, at the Beth Israel medical center, said researchers are already planning a longer study of a larger group of women.
