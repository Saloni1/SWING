1_0	0.27424798	New York broker Bernard Madoff's alleged giant pyramid scheme duped some of the world's smartest investors, reports suggested Saturday, adding to questions about why the scam wasn't uncovered earlier.

8_11	0.04609688	But a question still dominates the investigation: How one person could have pulled off such a far-reaching, long-running fraud, carrying out all the simple practical chores the scheme required, like producing monthly statements, annual tax statements, trade confirmations and bank transfers.
8_12	0.091656918	Firms managing money on Madoff's scale would typically have hundreds of people involved in these administrative tasks.
8_13	0.078883494	Prosecutors say he claims to have acted entirely alone.

8_18	0.076036857	While many investors were friends or met Madoff at country clubs or on charitable boards, even more had entrusted their money to professional advisory firms that, in turn, handed it on to Madoff -- for a fee.
8_19	0.089389604	Investors are now questioning whether these paid advisers were diligent enough in investigating Madoff to ensure that their money was safe.
8_20	0.063523972	Where those advisers work for big institutions like Banco Santander, investors will most likely look to them, rather than to the remnants of Madoff's firm, for restitution.

8_32	0.10033067	Madoff's family filled the senior positions, but his was not the only family at the firm -- generations of employees had worked for Madoff.
8_33	0.088101174	Even before Madoff collapsed, some employees were mystified by the 17th floor.
8_34	0.086793203	In recent regulatory filings, Madoff claimed to manage $17 billion for clients -- a number that would normally occupy a staff of at least 200 employees, far more than the 20 or so who worked on 17.
8_35	0.098366262	One Madoff employee said he and other workers assumed that Madoff must have a separate office elsewhere to oversee his client accounts.
8_36	0.10244274	Nevertheless, Madoff attracted and held the trust of companies that prided themselves on their diligent investigation of investment managers.
8_37	0.10481567	One of them was Walter M. Noel Jr., who struck up a business relationship with Madoff 20 years ago that helped earn his investment firm, the Fairfield Greenwich Group, millions of dollars in fees.
8_38	0.10025062	Indeed, over time, one Fairfield's strongest selling points for its largest fund was its access to Madoff.
8_39	0.094275668	But now, Noel and Fairfield are the biggest known losers in the scandal, facing potential losses of $7.5 billion, more than half its assets.
8_40	0.10664321	Jeffrey Tucker, a Fairfield co-founder and former federal regulator, said in a statement posted on the firm's Web site: "We have worked with Madoff for nearly 20 years, investing alongside our clients.
8_41	0.092177616	We had no indication that we and many other firms and private investors were the victims of such a highly sophisticated, massive fraudulent scheme."
8_42	0.096784815	The huge loss comes at a time when the hedge fund industry has already been wounded by the volatile markets.
8_43	0.10050178	Several weeks ago, Fairfield had halted investor redemptions at two of its other funds, citing the tough market conditions as dozens of hedge funds have done.
8_44	0.099094817	The firm reported a drop of $2 billion in assets between September and November.
8_45	0.098940547	Fairfield was founded in 1983 by Noel, the former head of international private banking at Chemical Bank, and Tucker, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official.
8_46	0.095568476	It grew dramatically over the years, attracting investors in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
8_47	0.10969333	Noel first met Madoff in the 1980s, and Fairfield's fortunes grew along with the returns Madoff reported.
8_48	0.096081431	The two men were very different: Madoff hailed from eastern Queens and was tied closely to the Jewish community, while Noel, a native of Tennessee, moved in the Greenwich social scene with his wife, Monica.
8_49	0.098571971	"Walter was always really confident in Bernie and the strategy he employed," said one hedge fund manager who declined to be named because for fear of jeopardizing his relationship with Noel.
8_50	0.096491283	"He was a person of superb ethics, and this has to cut him to the quick," said George L. Ball, a former executive at E. F. Hutton and Prudential-Bache Securities who knows Mr. Noel.
8_51	0.090498534	Fairfield touted its investigative skills.
8_52	0.11020117	On its Web site, the firm claimed to investigate hedge fund managers for six to 12 months before investing.
8_53	0.098060348	As part of the process, a team of examiners conducted personal background checks, audited brokerage records and trading reports and interviewed hedge fund executives and compliance officials.
8_54	0.098771309	In 2001, Madoff called Fairfield and invited the firm to inspect his books after two news reports questioned the validity of his returns, according to a person close to Fairfield.
8_55	0.097263846	Outside auditors hired to inspect Madoff's operations concluded that "everything checked out," this person said.
8_56	0.097794644	"FGG performed comprehensive and conscientious due diligence and risk monitoring," Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Fairfield, said in a statement.
8_57	0.097624541	"FGG like so many other Madoff clients was a victim of a highly-sophisticated massive fraud that escaped the detection of top institutional and private investors, industry organizations, auditors, examiners, and regulatory authorities."
8_58	0.098014103	Now, Fairfield is seeking to recover what it can from Madoff.
8_59	0.1089219	"It is our intention to aggressively pursue the recovery of all assets related to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities," Tucker said in a statement.
8_60	0.097985865	Working alongside the federal investigators on Madoff's 17th floor, staffers for Lee S. Richards 3d, the court-appointed receiver for the firm, are trying to determine what parts of the firm can keep operating to preserve assets for investors.
8_61	0.098017838	A hotline number had been posted on the company Web site, madoff.com, but on Sunday night, Richards said that there was little reason to call.
8_62	0.098105767	"We don't have anything to report to investors at this time," he said.
8_63	0.098954575	"We are doing everything we can to protect the assets of the Madoff entities that are subject to the receivership, and to learn what we can about the operations of those entities."
9_0	0.057455047	Deborah Coltin learned Friday morning that the $8 million foundation she has led for a decade, which supported a wide range of Jewish programs on the north shore of Massachusetts, did not actually exist.
9_1	0.408198	The foundation had invested its endowment with Bernard L. Madoff, a storied name on Wall Street.
9_2	0.10146728	Every year, Madoff paid out several hundred thousand dollars to the foundation.
9_3	0.26736773	But on Thursday, Madoff was charged with securities fraud after confessing to his sons that his business was a Ponzi scheme, according to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
9_4	0.17229742	The returns paid to investors came from money invested by other people.
9_5	0.069504286	And there was almost nothing left.
9_6	0.20621734	It may be the largest fraud in the history of Wall Street, authorities said.
9_7	0.071944139	Madoff is charged with stealing as much as $50 billion, in part to cover a pattern of massive losses, even as he cultivated a reputation as a financial mastermind and prominent philanthropist.
9_8	0.075222723	Coltin, executive director of the Robert I.
9_9	0.022802515	Lappin Charitable Foundation, said she spent the day at her office as a woman in mourning, taking condolence calls and trying to understand what happened.
9_10	0.07453668	"I laid off five people today," she said.
9_11	0.046327868	"Our foundation was the lifeblood of this community," she said.
9_12	0.075522568	"It's just very, very sad."
9_13	0.31539808	Madoff's investors included a number of prominent hedge funds and the firm of Fred Wilpon, the owner of the New York Mets.
9_14	0.10740194	Several may have sustained billions of dollars in losses.
9_15	0.12053286	But the damage appears to be deepest in the small world of Jewish philanthropy, where Madoff was a leading figure.
9_16	0.071098019	The North Shore- Long Island Jewish Health System said it lost $5 million.
9_17	0.034850006	The Julian J. Levitt Foundation, based in Texas and focused on Jewish causes, lost about $6 million.
9_18	0.17020984	Yeshiva University, a New York institution where Madoff served on the board, said it was examining how much money it invested with his firm.
9_19	0.10398256	Madoff's own $19 million foundation, which gave to a range of New York and Jewish causes, also was wiped out.
9_20	0.096385273	Ira Lee Sorkin, an attorney for Madoff, said Madoff's firm "is cooperating fully with the government."
9_21	0.039247495	"We're disturbed about these unfortunate events that have led to this," Sorkin said.
9_22	0.09346973	He declined to say whether Madoff, who has been released on bail, will fight the charges.
9_23	0.068126665	Madoff, 70, made his fortune as a middleman between buyers and sellers of stock.
9_24	0.075274184	He helped pioneer electronic trading as an alternative to the New York Stock Exchange, where buyers and sellers meet in person, and he eventually became chairman of Nasdaq, the first electronic stock exchange.
9_25	0.082594695	Madoff built himself into a brand.
9_26	0.078796475	He came to Wall Street with money saved as a Long Island lifeguard and built a family business employing many relatives, including his sons, and refused to sell the business or take it public.
9_27	0.08594471	He advertised his integrity.
9_28	0.13883686	"In an era of faceless organizations owned by other equally faceless organizations, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC harks back to an earlier era in the financial world: The owner's name is on the door," the company's Web site said.
9_29	0.094868251	"Clients know that Bernard Madoff has a personal interest in maintaining the unblemished record of value, fair-dealing, and high ethical standards that has always been the firm's hallmark."
9_30	0.11318316	By the late 1970s, and perhaps earlier, Madoff began managing money for investors, at least in part because he could require people to process trades through his firm.
9_31	0.11536399	Madoff eventually attracted billions of dollars from investors.
9_32	0.08808954	Some he knew personally.
9_33	0.10538281	Others belonged to clubs he was a member of, including the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida and Glen Oaks Country Club in New York.
9_34	0.12862585	Several large hedge funds invested with Madoff in part because he did not charge traditional fees, instead collecting money solely for processing trades.
9_35	0.090971945	The key attraction, however, was Madoff's remarkably successful track record.
9_36	0.093224689	A hedge fund run by Madoff, which described its strategy as focused on shares in the Standard & Poor's 100-stock index, averaged a 10.5 percent annual return over the past 17 years.
9_37	0.094778542	This year, amid a general market collapse, the fund reported that it was up 5.6 percent through November, while the S&P 500-stock index fell 38 percent.
9_38	0.083279678	The SEC charged in its complaint that the returns were artificial.
9_39	0.11016945	Madoff at some point started paying investors with money received from other investors, a Ponzi scheme, according to the SEC.
9_40	0.093651696	"Mr. Madoff lured investors to entrust him with substantial sums of money -- in some cases massive amounts of money -- with the false promise of great interest returns," said Mark Mulholland, a New York lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against Madoff.
9_41	0.10434529	He said his firm has been approached by two dozen investors, who lost up to $90 million.
9_42	0.098262863	The SEC said it is not clear when Madoff started using new investments to create the appearance of profits.
9_43	0.11589306	But the alleged ruse was finally exposed by the global financial crisis.
9_44	0.10975064	Madoff's investors had requested the return of about $7 billion by the end of the year, part of a broad trend in which investors are pulling massive sums from Wall Street.
9_45	0.1051629	Madoff told one of his sons earlier this month that he was struggling to find the money.
9_46	0.092134826	Then he told his other son that he was ready to pay annual bonuses to employees.
9_47	0.094289254	The sons confronted their father Wednesday, according to authorities, asking how the firm could pay bonuses if it couldn't pay investors.
9_48	0.092483497	Madoff asked them to come to his apartment, saying "he wasn't sure he would be able to hold it together" at the office, the SEC said.
9_49	0.092703455	There he said he was "finished."
9_50	0.099059209	The business was "a giant Ponzi scheme" -- "all just one big lie," the SEC documents said.
9_51	0.09919267	He estimated that his investors had lost $50 billion.
9_52	0.096365395	The sons reported Madoff to authorities.
9_53	0.096581903	Friday, a federal judge placed the company in receivership at the SEC's request.
9_54	0.098331452	Outside analysts had raised concerns about Madoff's firm for years.
9_55	0.096337606	The company made its own trades and held the shares it bought, unusual practices that kept its activities hidden from view.
9_56	0.097165245	Madoff also avoided filing disclosures of its holdings with the SEC; the firm said that at the end of every reporting period it sold its holdings and held only cash.
9_57	0.097551225	Such a tactic is highly unusual because it exposes a fund to large losses by forcing it to sell assets without regard to price.
9_58	0.097493129	Madoff, though a pioneer of electronic trading, also refused to provide clients online access to their accounts.
9_59	0.10786956	"This was extremely secretive, even for the non-transparent world of hedge funds," said Jake Walthour Jr., head of advisory services for Aksia, a New York consulting firm that advised clients not to invest in Madoff's funds.
9_60	0.097532826	"It was all done almost in fortress fashion to prevent anyone from knowing what was going on."
9_61	0.097944146	But a large number of investors apparently could not resist.
9_62	0.099988742	Robert Lappin started investing with Madoff in the early 1990s and eventually entrusted him with the entirety of his family foundation.
9_63	0.099470534	The Lappin Foundation, created "to keep our children Jewish," gave about $1.5 million to Jewish groups in 2007, including a long-standing program that has paid for about 1,800 teenagers to visit Israel.
9_64	0.09770947	Coltin, the executive director, went to sleep Thursday night with an inkling of bad news and woke up at 6 a.m. Friday, planning to call Lappin.
9_65	0.090457582	Before she could, the phone rang.
9_66	0.090145372	"He said: `I have to tell you this.
9_67	0.089725029	Our funds are frozen,' " Coltin said.
9_68	0.099581235	A little bit later, it became clear that the money had melted away.
