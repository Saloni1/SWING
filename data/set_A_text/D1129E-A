0_1	0.11045891	More vitamin D might mean less risk.
0_2	0.12559202	THE QUESTION Colorectal cancer seems to occur more often among those who live in sunshine-deprived areas, leading some people to theorize that the lack of vitamin D (which sun helps the body absorb) may play a role in the disease.
0_3	0.37347866	Might higher levels of vitamin D in the blood lower the likelihood of developing this cancer?
0_4	0.18509013	THIS STUDY combined and analyzed data from five studies, involving 1,448 healthy people whose blood was tested for the presence of the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, the main form of vitamin D in the circulatory system.
0_5	0.055437295	The participants' health was monitored for up to 25 years.
0_6	0.17028549	During that time, those whose blood registered the highest levels of vitamin D were the least likely to develop colorectal cancer.
0_7	0.11244896	For example, people with a 25(OH)D blood level of 33 nanograms per milliliter or higher were 50 percent less likely to have developed colorectal cancer than were those with a level of 12 ng/ml or lower.
0_8	0.23455033	The study estimated that taking 1,000 to 2,000 international units of vitamin D supplements daily would create a blood level of at least 33 ng/ml.

1_1	0.20260137	Building hope for one pill to prevent many cancers, vitamin D cut the risk of several types of cancer by 60 percent overall for older women in the most rigorous study yet.
1_2	0.14844228	The new research strengthens the case made by some specialists that vitamin D may be a powerful cancer preventive and most people should get more of it.
1_3	0.070300292	Experts remain split, though, on how much to take.
1_4	0.13212779	"The findings... are a breakthrough of great medical and public health importance," declared Cedric Garland, a prominent vitamin D researcher at the University of California-San Diego.
1_5	0.061752041	"No other method to prevent cancer has been identified that has such a powerful impact."
1_6	0.066468279	While the most reliable yet, the study does have drawbacks.
1_7	0.10697304	It was designed mainly to monitor how calcium and vitamin D improve bone health, and the number of cancer cases overall was small, showing up in just 50 patients.
1_8	0.07415439	"It's a very small study," said Dr. Edward Giovannucci, who researches nutrition and cancer at the Harvard School of Public Health.
1_9	0.072224288	"I don't think it's the last word."
1_10	0.068304016	In either case, the study takes an important step in extending several decades of research that began with observations that cancer rates among similar groups of people were lower in southern latitudes than in northern ones.
1_11	0.027552567	Scientists reasoned that had to do with more direct sunlight in southern regions.
1_12	0.21306925	The skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight's ultraviolet rays.
1_13	0.11807383	This study used that same form of the vitamin, known as D3 or cholecalciferol.
1_14	0.048358223	Multivitamins usually carry a much weaker variant known as D2, but D3 is available in stand-alone dietary supplements.
1_15	0.11148444	Earlier research has shown that vitamin D helps regulate cell growth, a fundamental biological process that goes haywire in cancer.
1_16	0.055441173	Most other supplements have tended to target specific types of disease in early testing, like selenium or vitamin E for prostate cancer.
1_17	0.16629099	This study, published Friday in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, is the first time that researchers significantly boosted -- and measured -- blood levels of vitamin D and then followed identical groups of patients from start to finish.
1_18	0.067060058	That is why, despite its modest size, the research was generating excitement.
1_19	0.058040224	Nearly all other work has compared disparate groups of patients.
1_20	0.070694995	The researchers at Creighton University in Omaha focused on 1,179 seemingly healthy women with an average age of 67.
1_21	0.073816647	The women were divided into three groups: 446 got calcium and vitamin D3 supplements, a similar number got calcium alone, and 288 took dummy pills.
1_22	0.15661628	The research team gave 1,000 daily international units of vitamin D, more than current guidelines calling for 200 to 600 units depending on a person's age.
1_23	0.093839118	The researchers intended to check mainly for the effects of calcium on bone health.
1_24	0.098581245	Their interest in cancer risk was secondary.
1_25	0.098138319	But the lower cancer risk stood out.
1_26	0.13117251	Only 13 women, or 3 percent, developed cancer over four years of calcium and vitamin D supplements.
1_27	0.089471222	With calcium alone, 17 women, or 4 percent, got cancer.
1_28	0.087328196	With dummy pills, cancer appeared in 20 women, or 7 percent.
1_29	0.11309666	That shows a 60 percent lower cancer risk over four years in the group taking both supplements, compared to patients taking placebos.
1_30	0.09042524	And when the first-year cancers were excluded -- the ones mostly likely present before the study began -- the findings were stronger still: a 77 percent lower risk for the combo group.
1_31	0.092445736	While the calcium-only group lowered its four-year cancer risk by 47 percent compared to the untreated group, it did no better when early cancers were excluded.
1_32	0.094026448	That suggests calcium alone may have done little in this experiment, the researchers said.
1_33	0.1090322	Experts reviewing the study focused on vitamin D as the powerful agent in the combo group, but it can't be ruled out that calcium might somehow amplify the effect of vitamin D.
1_34	0.098906517	While numbers were limited, these women developed a broad range of cancers, including disease of the breast, colon, lungs and blood.
1_35	0.10767304	Dr. Michael Holick, of Boston University Medical Center, who sat on the professional panel that issued the 1997 guidelines for vitamin D, said this study shows that enough vitamin D "markedly reduces the risk of developing the most serious deadly cancers."
1_36	0.10763668	He supports raising the recommended amount of the vitamin and said 1,000 daily units of vitamin D3 would now be reasonable for most people.
1_37	0.10188927	On the other hand, Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society favors keeping the current recommendation of 200 to 600 IUs for now.
1_38	0.096716139	And he cautioned that more than 2,000 units is viewed in the guidelines as potentially dangerous.
1_39	0.098520392	Joan Lappe, the study's lead researcher, said it "just adds to the great bunch of evidence that we need to have better vitamin D nutrition."
1_40	0.10263817	Some foods carry the vitamin, like salmon, tuna and fortified milk, but diet accounts for little of the vitamin circulating in the body.
1_41	0.098589962	Overexposure to the sun can cause skin cancer.
1_42	0.097574573	Still, people should consult their doctors before boosting their vitamin dosage, several experts also warned.

2_1	0.42300758	A high blood level of vitamin D could help reduce the risk of breast cancer by half and of colorectal cancer by two-thirds, the studies found.
2_2	0.21178164	Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in food and is made in the body because sunlight's UV rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin.
2_3	0.063800129	US health authorities have not established a recommended daily allowance for the vitamin due to insufficient scientific evidence.
2_4	0.18559332	For the breast cancer study, published online in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, researchers analyzed data from two earlier studies on the response to vitamin D doses among 1,760 people.
2_5	0.20619604	"The data were very clear, showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer, and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased," said study co- author Cedric Garland.
2_6	0.1812307	"The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun," he said.
2_7	0.23151079	The colorectal cancer research, published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed five studies on 1,448 individuals that explored the association of blood levels of vitamin D with colon cancer risk.
2_8	0.11657215	The incidence rate of colorectal cancer could be reduced by half with a serum level 34 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), the study found.
2_9	0.13104809	"We project a two-thirds reduction in incidence with serum levels of 46ng/ml, which corresponds to a daily intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3.
2_10	0.11318513	This would be best achieved with a combination of diet, supplements and 10 to 15 minutes per day in the sun," said study co-author Edward Gorham.
2_11	0.11818128	The researchers highlighted the importance of limiting sun exposure to avoid skin cancer risks.
2_12	0.097945251	They said a fair-skinned white person could get an adequate dose of vitamin D by spending 10 to 15 minutes in the noontime sun on a clear day with 50 percent of skin area exposed to the sun, while darker skinned people may need to stay as long as 25 minutes under the sun to achieve a similiar benefit.

4_1	0.2550611	Two new vitamin D studies have revealed new prescriptions for possibly preventing up to half of the cases of breast cancer and two-thirds of the cases of colorectal cancer in the United States.
4_2	0.18211061	The work was conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Cancer Center at University of California, San Diego, and colleagues from both coasts.
4_3	0.22717971	The breast cancer study, published online in the current issue of the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, found that individuals with the highest blood levels of 25- hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, had the lowest risk of breast cancer.
4_4	0.084501023	The researchers divided the 1,760 records of individuals into five equal groups, from the lowest blood levels of 25(OH)D (less than 13 nanograms per milliliter, or 13 ng/ml) to the highest (approximately 52 ng/ml).
4_5	0.074141554	The data also included whether or not the individual had developed cancer.

5_1	0.30053579	A U.S. research team has found that increased exposure to sunlight -- which increases levels of vitamin D in the body -- may decrease the risk of advanced breast cancer, according to a study reported Friday in the latest issue of American Journal of Epidemiology.
5_2	0.1315034	The researchers from the Northern California Cancer Center, the University of Southern California, and Wake Forest University found that women with high sun exposure had half the risk of developing advanced breast cancer, which is cancer that has spread beyond the breast, compared to women with low sun exposure.
5_3	0.060798187	These findings were observed only for women with naturally light skin color.
5_4	0.10495666	The fact that this difference occurred only in light skin color group suggests that the effect was due to differences in vitamin D production, said the researchers.
5_5	0.12892737	And the difference was seen only in women with advanced disease, suggesting that vitamin D may be important in slowing the growth of breast cancer cells.
5_6	0.15941561	"We believe that sunlight helps to reduce women's risk of breast cancer because the body manufactures the active form of vitamin D from exposure to sunlight," said Esther John, lead researcher on the study from the Northern California Cancer Center.
5_7	0.098107707	"It is possible that these effects were observed only among light- skinned women because sun exposure produces less vitamin D among women with naturally darker pigmentation."
5_8	0.12041676	Skin color is an important factor that determines how much vitamin D is produced in the body after sun exposure.
5_9	0.11342928	Dark- skinned individuals produce up to 10 times less vitamin D than light- skinned individuals for the same amount of time spent in the sun.
5_10	0.09974451	These new findings are consistent with previous research by John and colleagues that had shown that women who reported frequent sun exposure had a lower risk of developing breast cancer than women with infrequent sun exposure.
5_11	0.098377255	The researchers stressed that sunlight is not the only source of vitamin D, which can be obtained from multivitamins, fatty fish and fortified foods such as milk, certain cereals and fruit juices.
5_12	0.10850475	Women should not try to reduce their risk of breast cancer by sunbathing because of the risks of sun-induced skin cancer, they said.
5_13	0.10535354	"If future studies continue to show reductions in breast cancer risk associated with sun exposure, increasing vitamin D intake from diet and supplements may be the safest solution to achieve adequate levels of vitamin D," said Gary Schwartz, a co- researcher from Wake Forest University.
