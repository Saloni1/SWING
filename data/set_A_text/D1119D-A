1_1	0.42965463	The U.S. government is warning parents not to give cough and cold medicines to children under 2 without a doctor's order, part of an overall review of the products' safety and effectiveness for youngsters.
1_2	0.43645979	Amid questions about benefits and risks, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday its Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee will meet Oct. 18-19 to discuss the use of cough and cold drugs by children.
1_3	0.2185024	The FDA issued a public health advisory that cited serious adverse effects linked to children -- particularly those 2 and younger -- who have received too great a dose of over-the-counter medications for coughs and colds.

1_5	0.09432126	Other recommendations in the advisory included:
1_6	0.21115425	--Do not use cough and cold products in children under 2 unless given specific directions to do so by a health care provider.

2_1	0.41506855	Federal drug regulators have started a broad review of the safety of popular cough and cold remedies meant for children, a top official said Thursday.
2_2	0.43026611	The official, Dr. Charles J. Ganley, director of the office of nonprescription drug products at the Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview that the agency was "revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children" and that "we're particularly concerned about the use of these drugs in children less than 2 years of age."
2_3	0.24573696	In high doses, cold medicines can affect the heart's electrical system, leading to arrhythmias.
2_4	0.099343945	Some medicines affect the blood vessels and in high doses have been associated with hypertension and stroke.
2_5	0.28966535	In rare cases, children have been injured even when given recommended doses.
2_6	0.23144337	In a recent study of hospital emergency room records from 2004 and 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 1,519 children who were 2 years old had suffered serious health problems after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.
2_7	0.26067748	Three of the children died, the disease control agency found.
2_8	0.15656405	The FDA said it was too early to predict whether the review would lead to new regulations.
2_9	0.29819388	Its comments came in response to a petition filed Thursday by a group of prominent pediatricians and public health officials demanding that the agency stop drug makers from marketing cold and cough medicines for children under 6.
2_10	0.13447416	The petition says that the medicines do not work and that in rare cases they can cause serious injury.
2_11	0.31346007	Popular medicines like Toddler's Dimetapp, Infant Triaminic and Little Colds, which are marketed for use in children as young as 2, should not be given to young children under any circumstances, the petition says.
2_12	0.24167019	Like hundreds of older drugs, many of the medicines in these products do not get a thorough safety review by the FDA.
2_13	0.11706623	"So many people use these products even though they have no effect on colds and there's a real risk of a problem," said an author of the petition, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatrician and the health commissioner of Baltimore.
2_14	0.31197187	Ganley, of the FDA, said most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines had not been tested adequately in children.
2_15	0.16695709	The doses recommended on many of the products' labels were no better than educated guesses, he said.
2_16	0.18773549	"We have no data on these agents of what's a safe and effective dose in children," Ganley said.
2_17	0.23654457	Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group of companies that market over-the- counter cold remedies, said the remedies had been approved by the FDA and had been used for decades by millions of Americans.
2_18	0.12314023	Consumers should take only the recommended doses, Suydam said.
2_19	0.13085993	Doug Petkus, a spokesman for Wyeth, which makes Toddler's Dimetapp, agreed, adding that "parents of children under the age of 2 are encouraged to seek the advice of a physician before administering any over-the-counter medicine."
2_20	0.10327365	Such cautions "are clearly stated in product labeling," Petkus said.
2_21	0.32163899	The pediatricians who petitioned the drug agency acknowledged that children's cough and cold medicines were generally safe when given in recommended doses.
2_22	0.08930416	But they added that overdoses were common, for a variety of reasons.
2_23	0.10601398	Parents sometimes give their children two different brands, unaware that they contain the same active ingredients.
2_24	0.072556801	Overdoses can also result when frantic parents try to shove eyedroppers or cups of medicine into the mouths of crying, spitting babies.
2_25	0.10047043	The safety problems might be worth risking, the petitioners said, if the medicines worked to suppress coughs or clear stuffy noses.
2_26	0.18282137	But according to a growing number of studies in children, the drugs are no better than placebos.
2_27	0.11065612	"There is widespread consensus that there is no good evidence for the effectiveness of several of the compounds used in cold medicines," said Dr. Ian M. Paul, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine who has studied the medicines.
2_28	0.19119138	Last year, the American College of Chest Physicians recommended that parents avoid using cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones, because the medicines can cause serious problems.
2_29	0.15379886	Despite these growing worries, sales of the drugs are booming.
2_30	0.091912643	Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or more brands.
2_31	0.10484264	The market for these medicines is fed by parents looking for anything to get their children to sleep peacefully.
2_32	0.11412687	Children suffer an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than adults.
2_33	0.12842808	A 1994 study found that during one 30-day span, more than a third of the nation's 3-year-olds were estimated to have been given over-the-counter cough and cold remedies.
2_34	0.10150759	The products' labels and advertising strongly suggest that they work, many with flavors like grape and cherry.
2_35	0.10417715	Little Colds has a cartoon of a cheerful, crawling infant wearing only a diaper.
2_36	0.091041836	It promises that it "safely and gently relieves."

2_42	0.10111497	Most cough and cold concoctions have nasal decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants or expectorants -- common ingredients with names like dextromethorphan, guaifenesin and phenylephrine.
2_43	0.09738169	Most of these drugs have been around for decades and were approved for sale by the FDA when standards were far lower than they are today.The agency has put all the compounds on a "monograph," which means that drug manufacturers can use and combine them in pills and syrups without doing any of the expensive and lengthy studies that would be needed for a new drug.
2_44	0.10211969	Because the drugs are so widely available, there is no incentive for drug manufacturers to perform such studies.
2_45	0.099095123	Information about their lack of efficacy and worrisome side effects have trickled out.
2_46	0.10285449	Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group and a longtime critic of the FDA, noted that cold medicines have a troubled history.
2_47	0.097243654	A decade ago, many such medicines contained phenylpropanolamine, or PPA, until studies showing that it could cause hemorrhagic stroke led the FDA to ban it.
2_48	0.098251934	Given such problems, Wolfe said, the agency years ago should have taken a closer look at all common cold medicines.
2_49	0.1027637	Sharfstein said there was now enough evidence about the dangers of the drugs for the FDA to act.
2_50	0.098946448	"There is this incredible disparity between how the products are regulated and what the scientific evidence and consensus states," Sharfstein said.

7_2	0.26966455	The recommendation, in a 356-page safety review, is the clearest signal yet that the agency may take strong action against the roughly 800 popular medicines marketed in the United States under names like Toddler's Dimetapp, Triaminic Infant and Little Colds.
7_3	0.21907424	The next step in the process will be a meeting of outside experts on Oct. 18-19 to examine the medicines' safety and offer recommendations to the agency.
7_4	0.2817234	In the new safety review, the FDA's experts suggested that all "infant" cough and cold formulations be removed from the market, and that the droppers, cups and syringes included with products for children be standardized to reduce the risks of confusion and overdose.
7_5	0.36024441	The reviewers wrote that there is little evidence that these medicines are effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that they may be dangerous.
7_6	0.23378703	From 1969 to 2006, at least 54 children died after taking decongestants, and 69 died after taking antihistamines, the report said.
7_7	0.082052996	And it added that since adverse drug reactions are reported voluntarily and fitfully, the numbers were likely to significantly understate the medicines' true toll.
7_8	0.36560719	The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an industry trade group that has consistently defended the safety of pediatric cough and cold medicines, recommended in its own 156-page safety review, also released Friday, that the FDA consider mandatory warning labels saying that they should not be used in children younger than two.
7_9	0.3348981	Many cough and cold medicines now advise parents to "consult a physician" before use in such children.
7_10	0.11200023	The proposed warnings "are recommendations that we have brought forth and we look forward to having a thorough discussion with the FDA," said Virginia Cox, a spokeswoman for the trade group.
7_11	0.2161425	Despite the industry's recommendation, many companies -- including such giants as Johnson &amp; Johnson -- continue to sell cough and cold medicines with "infant" in their titles and pictures of babies on their labels.
7_12	0.23352335	Mark Boston, a spokesman for a Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary that sells pediatric cough and cold medicines, said the company "supports the materials" that the trade association submitted to the FDA, but declined to say why the company continues to sell such products as "Concentrated Tylenol Infants' Drops Plus Cold."
7_13	0.16222731	Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, Baltimore's commissioner of health and an author of a petition that led the FDA to conduct its current review, cheered its new report, saying it raised serious questions about why anyone would give cough and cold medicines to young children.
7_14	0.079412731	"These products are used by hundreds of thousands of kids every year, but no one can say that they're safe or effective," he said.
7_15	0.19841126	The petition followed a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that more than 1,500 children under the age of two had suffered serious health problems between 2004 and 2005 after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.
7_16	0.14719933	Current figures on the medicines' sales and use are not available, but in 1994 researchers reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association that more than a third of all three- year-olds in the United States were given over-the-counter cough and cold preparations in one 30-day span.
7_17	0.13150376	The petition noted that in 1990, Americans spent nearly $2 billion on these medications, and it said that in a typical drugstore, over 30 separate cough and cold preparations are marketed to parents for use in children.
7_18	0.12837637	Also on Friday, the FDA warned the makers of nearly 200 unapproved prescription medicines containing the pain-and-cough- relief drug hydrocodone that by Oct. 31 they must stop making these products for children under six.
7_19	0.081797088	Makers of all other unapproved hydrocodone products have until Dec. 31 to stop making them.
7_20	0.090234338	Hydrocodone is a narcotic that is widely used to treat pain and suppress cough.
7_21	0.09643303	There are seven FDA-approved prescription cough products containing hydrocodone, and doctors can continue to write prescriptions for those.
7_22	0.11206242	The agency's safety review and its decision to ban unapproved hydrocodone products both result from gradual but significant changes in the standards used for drug approvals.
7_23	0.15522925	In the case of pediatric over-the-counter medicines, the agency decided decades ago that drug makers could market the medicines for children even though they had only been tested in adults.
7_24	0.09379569	Back then, it was assumed that children's bodies were simply smaller versions of adult ones.
7_25	0.092343303	That assumption has proven untrue.
7_26	0.16413865	Indeed, a growing number of studies suggest that cough and cold medicines work no better in children than placebos.
7_27	0.10110469	Despite this, there are 800 such products on the market and sales have long been strong.
7_28	0.090467983	Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or more brands.
7_29	0.1094128	The medicines are popular largely because children have an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than adults.
7_30	0.10073177	Similarly, hydrocodone has never been shown to be safe and effective in children, and its dangers as a powerful and potentially addictive narcotic are clear.
7_31	0.097553576	Even more broadly, 200 hydrocodone-containing products never won approval from the modern-day FDA.
7_32	0.10335888	There are thousands of such unapproved drugs on the market.
7_33	0.098092	Indeed, an estimated 2 percent of all prescriptions are written for unapproved products.
7_34	0.098235259	Most have been around for decades, and the FDA is gradually forcing their makers to either get official approval or stop selling them.

8_1	0.32281712	Common children's cold and cough medicines are coming under scrutiny from federal drug regulators, who say the remedies and their recommended doses have not been studied enough in children, a newspaper reported.
8_2	0.32667562	Dr. Charles J. Ganley, a top Food and Drug Administration official, said the agency was "revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children," especially those under 2, The New York Times reported in Friday's editions.
8_3	0.42292929	Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been insufficiently tested in children, said Ganley, the director of the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products.
8_4	0.16854041	"We have no data on these agents of what's a safe and effective dose in children," he told The Times in an interview.
8_5	0.16993715	The FDA said it could not yet determine whether new regulations would result from the safety review, according to the newspaper.
8_6	0.23825562	A group of pediatricians and public health officials asked the agency Thursday to bar drug manufacturers from marketing such remedies as Toddler's Dimetapp, Infant Triaminic and Little Colds to children under 6.
8_7	0.18120915	A recent study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that more than 1,500 children under 2 had experienced serious health problems -- and three died -- after taking common cold medicines in 2004 and 2005.
8_8	0.24819985	The American College of Chest Physicians last year recommended avoiding using cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones.
8_9	0.11172337	In above-normal doses, cold medicines can lead to heart arrhythmias, and some have been linked to hypertension and stroke when taken in high doses, The Times reported.
8_10	0.12771841	In rare cases, children have had medical problems after taking recommended doses, the article said.
8_11	0.17569228	The president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents companies that sell over-the-counter cold drugs, noted that the medicines had FDA approval and had been used for decades.
8_12	0.12823132	They should be taken only in recommended doses, association president Linda A. Suydam said.
8_13	0.1206966	The pediatricians who petitioned the FDA Thursday acknowledged that children's cold medicines were generally safe in recommended doses, but they said overdoses were common because many children were given more than one medicine, among other reasons.
8_14	0.14615363	They also questioned the drugs' effectiveness in children.
8_15	0.10746518	Many cold and cough drugs won FDA approval decades ago, when the agency's standards were less strict, The Times reported.

9_1	0.49975442	U.S. government health officials said Friday they are reviewing whether popular medicines like Tylenol Plus Cold & Cough and Infant Triaminic Thin Strips are safe and effective in treating children's colds and coughs.
9_2	0.18949614	Disclosure of the review, which will take months to complete, came as critics charged that many over-the-counter cough and cold remedies can harm toddlers and preschoolers.
9_3	0.11912078	Those critics, including public health officials and pediatricians, are pushing the government for stricter warnings to prevent life-threatening overdoses.
9_4	0.23780816	"We have been looking at this issue internally with regard to the safety and efficacy of the use of these products in children," Dr. Charles Ganley, director of the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products, told reporters as he responded to a petition filed Thursday by city of Baltimore officials and others.
9_5	0.17959211	The review covers medicines that include decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants and expectorants.
9_6	0.13587237	The petition is far from the first warning about children using the medicines.
9_7	0.10844749	The American Academy of Pediatrics began issuing those warnings to parents in 1997.
9_8	0.14034629	And just two months ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 1,500 toddlers and babies wound up in emergency rooms over a two-year period because of the drugs.
9_9	0.17045585	The study's authors told parents to consult a doctor before giving the remedies to children under age 2.
9_10	0.24281522	In fact, the labels of every cough and cold remedy already caution parents to do just that, said Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents makers of over-the-counter, or OTC, medicines.
9_11	0.16606306	"OTC cough and cold remedies have a long history of safety when used according to the label.
9_12	0.10834083	The most important information for all consumers is that OTC medicines are real medicines and must be used according to the label instructions at all times," Suydam said in a statement.
9_13	0.095861933	Still, product packaging often bears images of children apparently much younger than 2, as well as terms like "infant" and "baby."
9_14	0.10432907	The petitioners called that misleading, adding that the average drug store stocks more than 30 such products.
9_15	0.14084678	Concentrated Tylenol Plus Cold & Cough, for instance, includes a picture of a mother and infant, even though its label recommends asking a doctor before using in children younger than 2.
9_16	0.10514999	Manufacturer McNeil Consumer Healthcare reiterated that advice in a statement.
9_17	0.093276198	A spokeswoman declined to comment further.
9_18	0.1493451	The FDA has never approved dosing recommendations for the 0-2 age group for the drugs.
9_19	0.094918421	Nor is it known just how much of their various ingredients it would take to injure or kill children that young, according to the CDC.
9_20	0.11026718	The petition asks the FDA to go further and require that labels say the products shouldn't be used to treat children younger than 6.
9_21	0.10485207	In Maryland alone, roughly 900 children 4 and younger overdosed on the medicines in 2004, according to the new petition.
9_22	0.10108402	In Baltimore, the medical examiner has linked the products to the deaths of at least four children under 4 in the last five years.
9_23	0.097288056	Yet these products have never been proven to benefit children so young, the petitioners argued.
9_24	0.10698073	Therefore, "we recommend that families be aware of these risks and not use over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children ages 5 and under," Baltimore officials said.
