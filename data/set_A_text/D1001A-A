0_3	0.3076923076923077	So many forms of community, rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to tell.
0_4	0.0	In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, still thrives.
0_5	0.16	``Jefferson County has 500,000 residents, but today our community is much larger,'' county commissioner Patricia Holloway said Sunday at a shopping-center parking lot service attended by 70,000 people -- a hastily stitched-together community unto itself.
0_6	0.25	There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine students and Columbine Valley residents.
0_7	0.0	There are myriad mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students, their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel, united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community.
0_8	0.0	The list continues onward, outward -- beyond metropolitan Denver, past President Clinton and his prayers, as far as the president of the West African nation of Ghana, who counted himself among the community of Littleton mourners and said ``something must be done to stop this thing.''
0_9	0.3333333333333333	The response is most visible in metropolitan Denver, radiating outward from the high school and adjacent Clement Park, which has become a mourner's Lourdes.

0_30	0.35294117647058826	``A community formed around that high school, and the school grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years.

0_32	0.0	Today, though a few patches of open prairie remain, houses continue to sprout.
