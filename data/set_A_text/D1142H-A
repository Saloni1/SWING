5_1	0.21711311	Seven bombs ripped through a centuries-old Indian city Tuesday, leaving at least 60 people dead in a jewelry market, on the steps of a Hindu monkey god temple and in other ordinarily packed areas of the popular tourist destination.
5_2	0.17522115	The blasts all struck within the old walls of Jaipur, a city in western India that's known for its pink-hued palaces, and suspicion quickly fell on Islamic militant groups blamed for a string of attacks on India in recent years.
5_3	0.12256497	"Obviously, it's a terrorist plot," said A.S. Gill, the police chief of Rajasthan, the state where Jaipur is located.
5_4	0.062563251	"The way it has been done, the attempt was to cause the maximum damage to human life," he said, adding an eighth bomb was found and defused by police.
5_5	0.19377952	Another senior Rajasthan police officer, A.K. Jain, said 60 people were killed and 150 wounded in the bombings.
5_6	0.11938297	No one claimed responsibility for the attack, as is the case with most bombings in India.
5_7	0.081847757	But within hours of the blasts, authorities were suggesting that blame would eventually fall on Pakistan and the Islamic militant groups New Delhi accuses it of backing.
5_8	0.072693424	"One can't rule out the involvement of a foreign power," said India's junior home minister, Sriprakash Jaiswal, using language commonly understood to refer to neighboring Pakistan.
5_9	0.050506289	Jaiswal refused to say if he was indeed talking about Pakistan -- "that's the subject of investigation," was all he would say.
5_10	0.094692003	But Indian authorities have blamed Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups for a spate of bombings that have killed nearly 400 people in this predominantly Hindu country of 1.1 billion people since 2005.
5_11	0.12671223	Pakistan, an overwhelmingly Muslim country, denies any role in the bombings.
5_12	0.09429839	The attacks have run the gamut from the July 2006 train bombings that left nearly 200 people dead in Mumbai, India's financial center, to small blasts like the one that struck a Muslim shrine in Rajasthan last year, killing two people.
5_13	0.11450835	Jaiswal suggested Tuesday's bombings were connected to those previous explosions, saying "the blasts are part of a big conspiracy."
5_14	0.10060748	Each new bombing has brought fears of a fresh outbreak of the violence between Hindus and Muslims that has sporadically bled India throughout its history, and authorities appealed for calm in the wake of Tuesday's attack.
5_15	0.11536721	Shortly after the bombings, authorities put New Delhi, India's capital, and Mumbai, the country's financial center, on high alert along with several other cities.
5_16	0.085004617	Security was also quickly stepped up at airports and railway stations across the country.
5_17	0.09926322	The blasts began around 7:30 p.m. (1400 GMT), and one hit a market near a temple dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman.
5_18	0.09117657	Tuesday is the day of worship set aside for Hanuman, and the temple was packed with people offering prayers on the way home from work.
5_19	0.10868633	Another blast took place near the Johari Bazaar -- the city's jewelry market, a popular destination for tourists.
5_20	0.097954057	The tourist season, however, ended in March and there were no immediate indications that foreigners had been caught in the explosions.
5_21	0.096031806	Parikshit Bhandari, who saw the attack near the jewelry market, said there was "blood all around and wounded people crawling on the ground."
5_22	0.097978583	Television channels showed footage of mangled bicycles, damaged cars and overturned bicycle rickshaws, the most popular mode of transport in the crowded lanes of Jaipur.
5_23	0.098800753	The city is one of the major attractions in Rajasthan, a desert region dotted with palaces and temples that draw hundreds of thousands of Indian and foreign tourists every year, from bargain-hunting backpackers to celebrities like Mick Jagger.
5_24	0.098412102	While no foreigners appeared to have been caught in Tuesday's attack, "We are all nervous.
5_25	0.098543875	We don't want Jaipur's economy to go down," said Manoj Sharma, a New Delhi travel agent.
5_26	0.098962831	Still, it'll be months before temperatures in Rajasthan dip below 100 degrees and the high season for tourists begins.
5_27	0.091129425	By then, he hopes, fears will have faded.
5_28	0.098192101	Associated Press reporters Sam Dolnick, Muneeza Naqvi and Ashok Sharma in New Delhi contributed to this report.
6_0	0.22193239	French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner Tuesday expressed revulsion at bomb blasts in Jaipur that claimed at least 80 lives, and offered to step up help to India in fighting terrorism.
6_1	0.1276651	"I wish to express my indignation and repugnance at the wave of attacks that have plunged the city of Jaipur into mourning," he said in a statement.
6_2	0.14067884	"France is more than ever willing to intensify cooperation with India in the anti-terrorist struggle," said Kouchner following the Tuesday bomb blasts at markets in the northern Indian tourist city.
6_3	0.11066802	"Today we are at the side of India and the Indian people in the face of this inconceivable horror," said the minister.
6_4	0.096545957	"We wish to assure the Indian government of our full support."

7_1	0.21895112	In the first terrorist attack in many months, seven bombs went off within minutes of one another on Tuesday evening in the crowded lanes of one of India's main tourist hubs, the historic city of Jaipur, with reports of deaths ranging from 50 upward, with roughly 150 injured, officials said.
7_2	0.10536677	The bombs were within a radius of 50 feet, the police said, and may have been planted in the wheels of bicycles, the mangled remains of which were found near many of the blast sites.
7_3	0.11908692	There were no claims of responsibility, which is typical of terrorist attacks in India.
7_4	0.061727594	But the junior minister for home affairs, Sriprakash Jaiswal, immediately said "foreign terrorists" were suspected, a phrase understood to refer to India's neighbor and nuclear rival, Pakistan.
7_5	0.08345687	Pakistan routinely denies Indian accusations that it is involved in any way in attacks on India.
7_6	0.10379484	The first explosion was about 7:30 p.m. near a temple dedicated to the Hindu god Hanuman that is especially crowded on Tuesday evenings.
7_7	0.060730266	Six more were in quick succession in the warrens of shops and monuments nearby, including the popular 18th-century tourist site called Hawa Mahal, and the Johri Bazaar, lined with jewelers.
7_8	0.083080089	Panic set in immediately, officials said.

7_12	0.090679897	On Wednesday morning, the superintendent of the main government hospital also said the toll was over 50.
7_13	0.10267101	The Indian federal government dispatched explosives experts from the National Security Group, and put several major cities on alert, including New Delhi.
7_14	0.10755358	Although Jaipur, known as the pink city, is a popular tourist destination, mid-May, the peak of the Indian summer, is not a busy season, and there were no reports that any foreigners had been killed.
7_15	0.11016009	The last major bombing in India was in August, when a pair of bombs went off in an outdoor auditorium and restaurant in the southern city of Hyderabad, killing more than 40.
7_16	0.098952988	Two years ago, serial blasts along the commuter train line in Mumbai, India's commercial capital, killed nearly 200.
7_17	0.097569442	Singh, the state spokesman, said that it was too early to say who was responsible, but that the attack, on a summer's evening when the walled city was thronged, appeared to be intended to ignite religious fury between Hindus and Muslims.
7_18	0.096453527	Similar terrorist attacks aimed at religious sites in recent years have not succeeded in setting off sectarian violence.
7_19	0.099348795	The Hindu holy city of Varanasi was struck by a pair of bombings in March 2006, killing 14, and a blast killed two worshipers in one of the holiest Muslim shrines in Ajmer, also in Rajasthan, last September.

8_5	0.054375072	Shopping bags, bloodied sandals and shoes were strewn around Johri bazaar, one of the hit markets, which security forces cleared quickly for fear of further blasts.
