0_1	0.072999879	Telomeres get shorter each time a cell divides.
0_2	0.0635665	Shorter telomeres indicate older cells and are thus a marker of biological ageing, which varies according to the individual.
0_3	0.06024841	British doctors measured the length of telomeres in the chromosomes of white blood cells among men aged 45-64 who had enrolled in a big study on coronary prevention in western Scotland.
0_4	0.076201299	The 484 men who went on to develop coronary heart disease had shorter telomeres than the 1,058 men who remained disease-free, the investigators discovered.
0_5	0.068825845	The same Scottish study also randomly assigned some volunteers to receive statins, a drug which breaks down artery-clogging cholesterol.
0_6	0.08208394	Other volunteers received a dummy lookalike pill called a placebo.
0_7	0.12033253	The researchers found that in the placebo group, the risk of heart disease was almost double among the men with short telomeres compared with counterparts with long telomeres.
0_8	0.11154215	But the good news was that in the statin group, those with short telomeres enjoyed a substantial cut in the risk of heart disease.
0_9	0.09989385	The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle- aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease and direct them to statin treatment.

2_1	0.072984458	Air pollution poses a greater risk to postmenopausal women, making them more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease, said a new study.
2_2	0.10854126	Postmenopausal women who live in areas with higher air pollution levels have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and of dying from it, said the study by researchers at the University of Washington.
2_3	0.045456174	The higher and longer the exposure to air pollution, the bigger the threat to postmenopausal women, warned the study appearing on the HealthDay News website.
2_4	0.1128235	The risk of heart disease is higher than previously thought, and there can be substantial variations within individual cities, said the study.
2_5	0.087510092	"The risk of having a cardiovascular event, that is, a heart attack, stroke or needing bypass surgery, or of dying of a cardiovascular cause, was increased," said study senior author Dr. Joel Kaufman, professor of environmental and occupational medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington.

5_1	0.068291328	The gradual erosion of telomeres, the strands of DNA capping chromosomes that wear away with each cell division, may play a pivotal role in heart disease, and drugs called statins may limit the damage, the New Scientist reported on Friday on its website.
5_2	0.127005	Researchers from Leicester and Glasgow Universities in the United Kingdom found that people who have much shorter telomeres are more likely to suffer from heart attacks.
5_3	0.062268671	In the five-year research, they first took blood samples from 484 middle-aged men with moderately raised cholesterol and from 1058 control subjects, and compared the telomere lengths in their white blood cells.
5_4	0.12636334	The researchers eventually found both patients and controls with the shortest telomeres were twice as likely to have developed serious heart disease,
5_5	0.059714495	They also found that statins, which are better known for their cholesterol- lowering properties, appeared to alleviate the effects of telomere damage and may even protect telomeres against degradation.
5_6	0.077684288	But the protective effect of statins was only seen in patients with comparatively short telomeres.
5_7	0.080359282	"In patients whose telomeres were wearing away at a normal rate, statin treatment didn't make any difference.
5_8	0.087847036	This suggests that statins were protecting against the worst cases of telomere degradation.
5_9	0.097677494	Without statins they might have been even shorter," Leicester University cardiologist Nilesh Samani, who led the research, was quoted as saying.
5_10	0.096966538	For years, doctors and scientists have suspected that another property of statins, unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering ability, explained how they protected patients from heart disease and stroke so effectively.
5_11	0.097885917	The discoveries made by Samani's team provide important new insights into the causes of arterial disease.
5_12	0.098149671	Samani said exactly how statins might limit the damage caused by telomere shortening or even directly protect telomeres was " speculation at this stage," but his group has already begun laboratory studies to test how the drugs interact with telomeres.

6_1	0.23500333	Congenital heart disease (CHD) has become more prevalent among adults as well as children, according to a latest study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.
6_2	0.066389429	Severe CHD has risen in adults by 85 percent and 22 percent in children during the 15-year study (1985-2000), the study said.
6_3	0.09030996	"This is the first study to measure the changing number of patients in a North American population during a period of major progress in the management of CHD," said Ariane J. Marelli, M.D., lead author of the study and director of the McGill Adult Unit for Congenital Heart Disease Excellence at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
6_4	0.054347217	"CHD has been thought of as a disease of childhood, but it has become an important disease of adulthood as well," Marelli said.
6_5	0.045498527	The study measured prevalence, age and proportion of adults relative to children at four time points: 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000, and analyzed the Quebec administrative databases recorded for the general population where access to health care is universal.
6_6	0.078101331	Quebec accounts for 25 percent of Canada's population.
6_7	0.057869906	"This is the largest population study of CHD to have been performed in North America," Marelli said.
6_8	0.057428751	"There is no reason to believe that the predominantly Caucasian population of Quebec and Canada is different from the United States."
6_9	0.072192468	Extrapolating the study findings to the U.S. population, Marelli estimated 1.8 million Americans had CHD in 2000 and that this number is increasing and will have implications for women, pregnancy and genetics.
6_10	0.067405691	She estimated about 900,000 adults and 900,000 children had CHD.
6_11	0.076240983	In 2000, the study indicated that one of every 85 children had CHD and one of 250 adults had CHD.
6_12	0.081579313	"For comparison purposes, cystic fibrosis occurs in one of 4,500 live births, so there are 45 times more children with CHD than children with cystic fibrosis and most of these children are nowbecoming adults," Marelli said.
6_13	0.088347658	Furthermore, more adults have had CHD than children since 1985, and a preponderance are women, the study found.
6_14	0.092197847	"Between 1985 and 2000, the group of patients that rose the most rapidly were adults with severe CHD, so, as of 2000, there was a nearly equal number of children and adults with severe CHD," Marelli said
6_15	0.094451815	The most significant increases in CHD were in adolescents (13 to 17 years old) and in young adults (18 to 25), according to the study.
6_16	0.096471452	The median age of those with severe CHD increased markedly from 1985 to 2000.
6_17	0.098273844	The median age in 1985 was 11 years compared to 17 years in 2000.

6_19	0.097321085	Most heart defects either obstruct blood flow in the heart or vessels near it, or cause blood to flow through the heart in an abnormal way.
6_20	0.099605262	Marelli considers CHD a major public health problem in North America that is largely under-recognized.
6_21	0.09842107	"We need to increase public awareness for congenital heart disease in order to be able to better care for the increasing number of young people with heart disease," Marelli said.

7_1	0.10451025	British researchers have found why childhood trauma caused by abuse increases a person's risk of developing disease later in life, the New Scientist reported in it latest issue on Saturday.
7_2	0.12795367	Previous studies have suggested that childhood trauma increases a person's risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and other disorders normally associated with obesity in adulthood.
7_3	0.084695574	Researchers studying inflammation in the bloodstream at King's College London monitored 1,000 people in New Zealand from birth to the age of 32, noting any factors that created stress, and recorded levels of C-reactive protein in their blood, which is a marker of inflammation and has been linked to heart disease.
7_4	0.084735138	The researchers found that people who reportedly have been physically or sexually abused, or rejected by their mothers at a young age, were twice as likely to have significant levels of C-reactive protein in their blood.
7_5	0.093140348	The researchers believe that stress induces abnormal levels of inflammation in children, which has repercussions in adulthood.
7_6	0.092067843	"Inflammation is a natural response to physical trauma such as cutting yourself or getting an infection," Andrea Danese who led the research was quoted as saying.
7_7	0.095726957	Constant stress could also reduce a child's ability to produce glucocorticoid hormones, which are the main mechanism the body uses to turn off inflammation, Danese holds, hoping his work will help people identify those at risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age.

8_1	0.10923413	Doctors soon may be employing a simple blood test to help them determine which heart patients are at greatest risk for heart attack, stroke and death.
8_2	0.073071955	The test has been used for years in hospital emergency rooms to confirm a diagnosis of heart failure.
8_3	0.097703225	And it's now proven an excellent predictor of the severe consequences of heart disease, even when other, more routine tests are negative.
8_4	0.059784892	Findings from the University of California San Francisco will not immediately change the way patients with symptoms of heart trouble are assessed, but may eventually play a key role in guiding doctors to treatment decisions.
8_5	0.084665916	"Our goal is to determine who are the high risk patients, so we can target medical and surgical therapies we know to be life- saving to those most likely to benefit," said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, whose research was published in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
8_6	0.081204979	An estimated 71 million Americans have some form of cardiovascular disease.
8_7	0.24104354	It remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
8_8	0.046229435	The blood test, which takes less than an hour to complete, measures levels of a substance known cryptically as N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain-type natriuretic peptide, or NT- proBNP.
8_9	0.059770917	The peptide, and its cousin, brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), are released from the lower chambers of the heart when it is under stress.
8_10	0.093937369	Elevated levels of the peptide in the blood mean the heart is working too hard.
8_11	0.069445105	Common heart disease drug therapies such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics can decrease the levels, making BNP and NT-proBNP effective markers for cardiac conditions.
8_12	0.065301693	Until now, however, doctors have limited the test's use to confirmation of heart failure, a progressive illness in which the heart can no longer efficiently pump blood to other organs and muscles.
8_13	0.070688146	A patient who comes into the emergency room with shortness of breath, for example, may be given the test to rule out other causes of the symptom, such as asthma.
8_14	0.07314274	Bibbins-Domingo and her colleagues wondered whether the test also could be used to determine the long-term prognosis of patients with a history of heart problems.
8_15	0.090908586	"So we studied 1,000 people who already had heart disease, and we were interested in determining whether we could predict who would go on to have another heart attack, stroke, heart failure, or die," she said.
8_16	0.083920891	After four years they found that the higher the level of the peptide in the blood at the outset, the higher their chances were for having an adverse cardiac event.
8_17	0.087098808	For example, patients whose heart peptide levels put them in the top quarter of those tested, had a nearly 8-fold increased rate of cardiovascular events or death compared with those whose peptide levels were lowest.
8_18	0.086093657	The most surprising finding was that the test accurately predicted a high risk, even when traditional assessments such as treadmill stress tests and echocardiography failed to confirm it.
8_19	0.092528566	Traditionally, the best test to predict a patient's high risk of dying from heart disease is echocardiography, which can detect a weak heart muscle, said Dr. David Roberts, a cardiologist and medical director of the catheterization laboratory at Sutter Medical Center.
8_20	0.091625445	That test, which uses sonography, measures the ejection fraction, or the percentage of blood squeezed out by the heart each time it beats.
8_21	0.097319558	The lower the percentage, the higher the risk of death, he explained.
8_22	0.09596431	"The (peptide test) properly identified people at high risk for dying, even with ejection fraction was OK," he said.
8_23	0.091468495	"That is a surprise."
8_24	0.097976599	Roberts said he would put the peptide test in the same category as calcium scoring, a cardiac testing approach that uses an X-ray to determine the amount of calcium buildup on artery walls.
8_25	0.096905994	"This gives us more markers to help identify high-risk individuals," he said.
8_26	0.098229608	"If it is high, you better take a close look at that person and maybe do some more testing."
8_27	0.098628272	Study authors emphasized, however, that the test should not replace others used to determine cardiac risks and that it will not likely be used routinely until additional research is done.
8_28	0.098604837	Specifically, Bibbins-Domingo said, researchers need to determine whether the assessment tool can lead to better, more appropriate therapies and ultimately improved outcomes for patients.
8_29	0.097082648	The heart peptide test might help decide, for example, whether a patient needs coronary artery bypass surgery, considered a highly effective, but risky approach to cardiovascular disease.
8_30	0.098268579	"This might be a way to help inform the discussion between a doctor and patient about whether their risk of developing another heart attack or failure in the future is so high that they are willing to undergo an intervention like a bypass surgery," she said.
9_0	0.097431124	Scientists have new evidence that gum disease may be linked to more serious health problems, in this case pancreatic cancer.
9_1	0.10181256	The researchers stressed that the findings need to be confirmed and explored by additional research, but it is not the first time that periodontal disease has been associated with other serious illness.
9_2	0.16943145	Previous research suggested that people with infected gums may be more prone to heart disease.
9_3	0.064132247	Over time, the bacterial infection that causes gum disease can also cause loss of the bone that anchors the teeth, and the inflammation from the infection may set the stage for other serious diseases.
9_4	0.071191585	Pancreatic cancer strikes more than 33,000 Americans each year and kills more than 30,000, making it the fourth-leading cause of cancer death.
9_5	0.089008671	For the study, Dominique S. Michaud of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston and colleagues analyzed data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which has gathered data about a wide range of health issues from 51,529 American men.
9_6	0.095422033	After taking other factors into consideration, such as age, smoking, diabetes and body mass index, the researchers found that the men with gum disease were 63 percent more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than those without gum disease.
9_7	0.095619142	Non-smokers with gum disease were twice as likely to develop the hard-to- treat cancer as those with healthy gums.
