2_1	0.24683885	International fisheries officials are expected to push for a global tracking system that would certify the origin of every tuna headed to market at an unprecedented conference that convenes Monday to reverse a sharp decline in tuna catches.
2_2	0.73993062	The conference brings together the world's regional tuna management groups and runs through Friday in the western city of Kobe.
2_3	0.23505748	It is seen as a key step in combatting the downturn in one of the most valuable and endangered high seas fisheries.
2_4	0.25305409	Attendees, representing the commercial fishing industry as well as government regulators, will seek the creation of a framework requiring fishermen worldwide to produce certificates of origin for all species of tuna they catch, Kyodo News reported Sunday, citing a draft action plan for the meeting.
2_5	0.077498385	Doing so would help clamp down on excessive or illegal fishing, it said.
2_6	0.099103182	Requiring certificates of origin for all tuna would expand the conservation programs already under way in some regions, which cover certain threatened species such as bluefin tuna, Kyodo reported, without saying how it got the draft or who wrote it.

2_13	0.13367454	Overfishing and illegal fishing is often cited as the cause.
2_14	0.20167844	In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna agreed at a meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, to reduce the global catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna by more than 20 percent for 2007.
2_15	0.1251321	At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the southern bluefin tuna as punishment for overfishing, but denied allegations it has poached thousands of tons of the endangered species every year.
2_16	0.10485065	Concern has been growing about overfishing of tuna and other fish species.
2_17	0.097709261	In November, a study in the journal Science warned that if current trends of overfishing and pollution continue, the populations of just about all seafood face collapse by 2048.
