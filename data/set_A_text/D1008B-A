1_0	0.0	After struggling for decades against an orange-toothed rodent that is eating the state's marshes, authorities in Maryland have claimed their first major victory over the nutria.
1_1	0.0	The animals, which are blamed for thousands of acres of vanished wetland statewide, have been eliminated from their former stronghold in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, officials said.
1_2	0.0	All it took was two years, $2 million and 15 trappers working in chest-deep muck here on the Eastern Shore.
1_3	0.0	About 8,300 nutria were killed during the eradication, which officials said was planned like a military campaign, using Global Positioning System equipment.
1_4	0.0	In monetary terms, nutria cause about $2.8 million worth of economic damage annually by reducing opportunities for hunting, fishing and hiking, according to a report by the Department of Natural Resources.
1_5	0.2777777777777778	Although nutria remain in the state, Maryland is being lauded as a rare success story in the government's fight against the pest, which has colonized states from the Chesapeake Bay to Oregon.
1_6	0.0	``We proved it can be done,'' said Jonathan McKnight, an official with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
1_7	0.0	The Blackwater refuge originally contained about 13,000 acres of marshland, situated near the Chesapeake in Dorchester County.
1_8	0.0	Nutria were introduced there when a few of the South American animals either escaped or were released from a federal fur research project in 1943.
1_9	0.0	For the nutria, which resemble waddling beavers with naked tails, the area turned out to be a garden spot.
1_10	0.0	There were huge expanses of a marsh plant they love, called three-square bulrush.
1_11	0.07692307692307693	For the bulrush, and the numerous species of birds, fish and mammals that lived in the bulrush marshes, the news wasn't so good.
1_12	0.0	Nutria act like a ``mammalian lawn mower,'' in the words of scientist Robert Thomas, a professor at Loyola University in New Orleans -- eating the plants, roots and all, and leaving huge stretches of bare mud.
1_13	0.0	Without roots to hold it, in many places the mud simply washed away.
1_14	0.0	About half of the refuge's marshland, a crucial pollution filter that scientists call the ``kidneys'' of the Chesapeake, had become open water by the 1990s.
1_15	0.0	Authorities first offered rewards to trappers who caught nutria: $1.50 apiece.
1_16	0.0	But when nutria became difficult to find, trappers decided the rodent wasn't worth their time.
1_17	0.0	Any remaining animals -- blessed with an ability to produce more than 10 young in a year -- would then quickly repopulate.
1_18	0.0	``It's sort of like a whack-a-mole game,'' said Steve Kendrot, the Department of Agriculture official in charge of Blackwater's trapping efforts.
1_19	0.0	Government officials also tried to make nutria into a dinner-table delicacy.
1_20	0.0	That, too, failed: People who will eat nutria are pretty much the same people who eat muskrat -- not much of a mass market.
1_21	0.0	``There's just not a lot of people out there who can stomach them,'' said Dan Murphy of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Chesapeake office.
1_22	0.0	Including him: ``I don't eat rat,'' Murphy said.
1_23	0.0	The idea behind the recent eradication effort was to use full-time trappers, paid by the hour and not by the nutria.
1_24	0.0	The trappers would act like a conquering army, slowly taking territory in a west-to-east march that was guided by GBS equipment.
1_25	0.0	In the summer, the trappers had to fend off mosquitoes and biting greenhead flies.
1_26	0.0	There were also spiders and the danger of the occasional bite from a nutria's inch-long orange buckteeth.
1_27	0.0	Winter in the marsh, while often frigid, turned out to be the easy season.
1_28	0.0	Once the water froze, the nutria couldn't swim away, and trappers could shoot them by the dozens on the ice.
1_29	0.0	``There's really about two months of the year when this is a pleasant occupation,'' Kendrot said.
1_30	0.0	This September, the anti-nutria team got the news they were waiting for: Surveys showed they had effectively cleared the animals from more than 35,000 acres in and around Blackwater.
1_31	0.0	As it turned out, the nutria death toll had been much lower than they expected, since early speculation was that 50,000 ``nutes'' were in the refuge.
1_32	0.0	Scientists say the rest were killed by recent cold winters or by a decline in food, as so much of the marsh already was eaten.
1_33	0.0	With the nutria gone, the marsh is starting to look the way it did 70 years ago, officials said.
1_34	0.0	(Begin optional trim)
1_35	0.0	Officials in Maryland said they hope their success can be a model for the roughly 16 other states with nutria problems.
1_36	0.0	But in Louisiana, the only state with a bigger nutria population than Maryland's, authorities said they doubted whether a similar eradication was possible there.
1_37	0.0	Millions of nutria are in that swampy state, and trappers routinely match the catch at Blackwater, about 8,300, in a couple of days.
1_38	0.25	In Maryland, authorities say they want to slowly expand their nutria-free zone to include the rest of the Eastern Shore, where tens of thousands more nutria lurk between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Ocean City.
1_39	0.0	The whole effort will require millions more in funding and many more trappers, officials said.
1_40	0.0	``It was a major battle that has, for the most part, been won,'' said Jacoby Carter, a national expert on nutria for the U.S. Geological Survey.
1_41	0.0	``But you've got to worry about the guerrilla warfare.''
2_0	0.25	Maryland may be rushing crucial research on introducing Asian oysters into the Chesapeake Bay, the states of Delaware and New Jersey said this week, joining several federal agencies in asking that the new species be studied further.
2_1	0.0	The states issued a statement saying that the Asian oyster is still ``a virtual unknown'' and could bring diseases or other ecological problems that would spread to their coasts.
2_2	0.0	They urged officials in Maryland, where Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) has been a vocal proponent of the Asian oyster, not to make a decision as scheduled early next year.
2_3	0.0	``I think their process would benefit from a little more deliberation,'' said Roy Miller, administrator of fisheries for the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife.
2_4	0.0	Maryland officials responded Wednesday that they would not make any moves before they were sure the new oyster is safe.
2_5	0.0	``We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions about,'' said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.
2_6	0.0	The two states' criticism marks a new turn in the saga of Crassostrea Ariakensis, a native of China that has recently caused unusual divisions within the staid world of shellfish management.
2_7	0.26666666666666666	It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
2_8	0.0	Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.
2_9	0.0	``We're so low that the next stop is zero,'' said Pete Jensen, an official with the Department of Natural Resources.
2_10	0.0	The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake.
2_11	0.0	But scientists believe there are many potential downsides -- even beyond the dinner-table prospects of an oyster that can resemble an orange portobello mushroom cap.
2_12	0.0	Scientists point to the havoc caused in the bay ecosystem by other nonnative species: The mute swan and beaverlike nutria chew up crucial grasses, and the toothy northern snakehead has worried fishermen in the Potomac River.
2_13	0.0	They worry that the Asian oysters could bring new diseases or adapt to the Chesapeake so well that they squeeze out native species of oysters and clams.
2_14	0.08	To answer such questions fully might take many years of research, according to reports by the National Academy of Sciences and a trio of federal agencies: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
2_15	0.0	Julie Thompson, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service, said Wednesday that the federal agencies were concerned that the Asian oyster would be impossible to remove once released in the wild.
2_16	0.0	``After it's done, it's going to be irreversible,'' she said.
2_17	0.0	Franks said Wednesday that all the necessary research has been compressed into a year.
2_18	0.0	That study, performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, could be finished in the next couple of weeks, he said.
2_19	0.0	After that, Franks said, the data will be reviewed by a panel of experts appointed by Ehrlich and Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D).
2_20	0.0	Based on their recommendations, Ehrlich and Warner will decide whether to move forward on the oysters or to request more research, Franks said.
2_21	0.0	Delaware and New Jersey will not have a say.
3_0	0.47619047619047616	The Chesapeake Bay Foundation will file a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday, signaling a more aggressive strategy for a group that has grown increasingly frustrated over the slow progress in cleaning up the bay.
3_1	0.23529411764705882	The lawsuit, a copy of which was released Tuesday, accuses the federal agency of dragging its feet as sewage plants across the region pollute the bay's waters.
3_2	0.058823529411764705	Specifically, the suit asks that the EPA respond formally to the bay foundation petition submitted in December seeking limits on the amount of nitrogen released from such plants.
3_3	0.1	``Our only recourse is to litigate,'' said William C. Baker, the bay foundation's president.
3_4	0.0	``We've tried ... to give EPA a chance to fulfill its promises.''
3_5	0.058823529411764705	The suit is one of several recent legal steps initiated by environmental groups, which traditionally have relied on consensus, rather than confrontation, with government agencies in the effort to clean up the bay.
3_6	0.0	The foundation already is suing Virginia over what it believes were lax pollution permits issued for a sewage plant in Onancock and a Philip Morris industrial plant.
3_7	0.3333333333333333	And Maryland watermen are considering a class-action lawsuit against polluters, including sewage treatment plants and manufacturers that dump into the bay's watershed.
3_8	0.0	The key issue in the legal action to be filed Wednesday is nitrogen, which along with phosphorus serves as food for huge algae blooms in the bay.
3_9	0.1111111111111111	Scientists blame these algae for creating ``bad water'' where fish and crabs cannot breathe.
3_10	0.13333333333333333	For those trying to clean the bay, the problem is that nitrogen comes from everywhere, including from animal manure that washes off farm fields and from leaky septic systems.
3_11	0.4166666666666667	The more than 350 sewage plants in the Chesapeake Bay watershed account for about 21 percent of its nitrogen, according to the EPA.
3_12	0.0625	In its petition filed in December, the bay foundation noted that almost none of those sewage plants had permits that limited nitrogen pollution and asked the EPA to remedy that.
3_13	0.0	EPA regulators responded with a draft proposal that eventually would impose such permits on most of the plants.
3_14	0.0	That plan, if authorized by EPA leaders, could be implemented by spring, agency officials said Tuesday.
3_15	0.06666666666666667	``There's no disagreement with the bay foundation that this is a necessary next step,'' said Jon Capacasa, an official at the EPA regional office that oversees the bay.
3_16	0.05	But the federal agency has not provided a formal answer to the bay foundation's demands, and Baker said the draft proposal contains ``weasel words'' that might allow the EPA to back out of key provisions.
3_17	0.13333333333333333	So the bay foundation decided to go to court, asking a federal judge in Washington D.C. to speed up the EPA's formal response.
3_18	0.058823529411764705	Baker said that environmentalists are frustrated that the bay has made so little progress in the three decades since the cleanup began, and particularly in the four years since the signing of the landmark Chesapeake 2000 agreement.
3_19	0.3684210526315789	That agreement -- signed by the EPA, the D.C. mayor and the governors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania -- set a goal of removing the Chesapeake from the national ``impaired waters'' list by 2010.
3_20	0.15384615384615385	With nearly half the time gone, most of the efforts are still in the planning stages, and Baker said his organization has lost patience with the EPA.
3_21	0.0	``We think that 41/2 years is enough time to determine that they are not interested'' in moving more quickly, he said.
3_22	0.07142857142857142	Still, some observers, including Bill Matuszeski, who formerly oversaw the EPA's Chesapeake cleanup effort, worry that lawsuits might bog down the process further.
3_23	0.0	``Tying this whole issue up in court isn't going to move it forward at all,'' he said.
4_0	0.043478260869565216	The sun had just risen over the Patuxent River when the crew of the Aquarius launched its routine: casting a 30-foot net off the trawler's bow, hauling it in and flinging its contents of writhing fish and crabs onto a wooden slab.

4_2	0.0	It's a ritual that scientists and anglers have performed for ages in an effort to understand the world beneath the water's surface.
4_3	0.0	But what happens to the data collected on the Aquarius is totally new, a small part of an ongoing revolution in how humans manage marine life.

4_11	0.0	Each has its champions.
4_12	0.0	The bass spawn in the bay and are favorites of gourmets and recreational anglers, who bring the bay area about $500 million a year.
4_13	0.07692307692307693	The menhaden -- an oily, inedible, bony little fish -- is the basis of this country's second-largest commercial fishing industry.
4_14	0.0	It is used in a variety of products from cattle feed to vitamin supplements.
4_15	0.0	About a third of the menhaden caught in the United States are caught in Virginia and off the North Carolina coast, the two East Coast states that allow menhaden processing.
4_16	0.3	As a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the algae and other particles in the bay, the menhaden ``ecologically speaking, (is) the most important animal'' in the bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation says.
4_17	0.25	``We should look at menhaden as a keystone of the Chesapeake Bay, rather than a little, oily, bony thing out of which you can make cat food,'' said David Festa, director of the Oceans Program at the Environmental Defense Fund.
4_18	0.05	Many conservation and anglers groups accuse the menhaden industry, which uses spotter planes to locate schools, of catching too many fish -- starving the striped bass and upsetting the bay ecosystem.
4_19	0.0	The industry has responded by blaming the bass.
4_20	0.0	As their numbers grow, industry officials said, bass are eating too many menhaden.
4_21	0.18181818181818182	As federal biologists begin to test ecosystem-based management, the debate around menhaden and bass is heating up.
4_22	0.0	Conservation and anglers' groups each have said they are sure the new approach will prove their points.
4_23	0.0	Industry advocates said that they also favor viewing the fisheries as one interconnected system but that current data aren't sufficient to limit fishing for menhaden in the bay.
4_24	0.05555555555555555	Advocates who last were together 20 years ago, when declining stocks of striped bass prompted an East Coast ban on catching the fish, are reuniting to take on the menhaden industry.

7_13	0.045454545454545456	That is because Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000 bushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in 1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885.

9_0	0.0	Years of paltry oyster harvests have left Bill Beck, a waterman on Maryland's Eastern Shore for 21 of his 39 years, wondering if the business will exist by the time his 9-year-old son reaches adulthood.
9_1	0.0	Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day earns Beck just $25,000 a year.
9_2	0.2777777777777778	The dwindling supply of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay -- last season's haul was about 24,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of what it was three decades ago -- has hurt him the most.
9_3	0.0	``It's getting worse.
9_4	0.3333333333333333	There's no oysters.
9_5	0.0	There's nothing there,'' Beck said.
9_6	0.0	Last weekend, three generations of the Beck family -- Bill, son Craig and father John, 76 -- boarded their boat with renewed optimism as nearly 4,000 bushels of disease-free oysters were made available for harvesting for the first time since they were hatched and planted three years ago.
9_7	0.038461538461538464	The Becks were among two dozen watermen, some scuba-diving and some using hand tongs, who set out to get their share of the disease-free oysters from three managed reserves, known as Emory Hollow and Blunts Bar in the Chester River and Bolingbroke Sands in the Choptank River.
9_8	0.2	The oysters were spawned at the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science, then planted in the managed reserves, where they grew under the supervision of scientists.
9_9	0.0	Almost 200 million oysters have been planted since 2001, officials said.
9_10	0.047619047619047616	While watermen have been able to harvest oysters elsewhere, they agreed not to harvest in the managed reserves for several years until the majority of the oysters grew to four inches, one inch bigger than the state's legal size.
9_11	0.0	Those oysters command a higher price and have a better chance of reproducing, organizers said.
9_12	0.0	In return, state officials promised to open up the oyster bars periodically, particularly around the holidays when demand is higher.
9_13	0.0	The watermen will next be able to harvest oysters, which also help filter the water, at the three sites Nov. 13.
9_14	0.3333333333333333	``It's a beautiful concept in a sense because it's brought commercial interests and environmental interests together,'' said William Goldsborough, a senior scientist at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
9_15	0.0	Yet not everyone left with big bundles of oysters Saturday.
9_16	0.0	At Emory Hollow, the seven participating watermen collected just 10 to 15 bushels.
9_17	0.0	The nine watermen at the Blunts Bar site fared better, collecting 97 bushels.
9_18	0.0	``Terrible,'' Bill Beck said.
9_19	0.0	``It took us over an hour to catch a bushel.''
9_20	0.0	The Becks had worked diligently along the Chester River, Bill Beck dragging a hand tong through the water as his son and father sorted and measured their catch.
9_21	0.11764705882352941	Mathilde Egge, program administrator for the Oyster Recovery Partnership, one of the project managers, said many Emory Hollow oysters were smaller than four inches and couldn't be harvested.
9_22	0.0	Organizers would try to determine how to ensure that oystermen take home a bigger haul before the next harvesting, Egge said.
9_23	0.4090909090909091	Several organizations and federal agencies worked together to manage the project, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Oyster Recovery Partnership, a nonprofit group whose mission is to restore the bay's oyster population.
9_24	0.1	The managed reserve program is one of many efforts to reverse what scientists have called a disturbing trend.
9_25	0.75	Once the Chesapeake Bay's premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to over-harvesting and disease.
9_26	0.07142857142857142	In addition to the managed reserve program, some researchers have turned to creating sanctuaries filled with oysters that watermen are barred from harvesting.
9_27	0.0	The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a nonnative -- and, they hope, disease-resistant -- species to the bay.
9_28	0.14285714285714285	Federal funding for oyster restoration efforts in Maryland and Virginia exceeded $4 million this year, organizers of Saturday's event said.
9_29	0.4666666666666667	The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
9_30	0.0	David Phillips, 42, a waterman from Wittman, Md., said he welcomes any effort to increase the oyster supply.
9_31	0.0	Phillips drove his boat 20 miles to Emory Hollow, a nearly two-hour trip, to participate.
9_32	0.0	``I think it's a great opportunity,'' said Phillips, who hopes such efforts will save his profession.
9_33	0.0	``It's a dying breed,'' Phillips said.
9_34	0.0	``Everybody that was on the water got off the water because you can't make a living.''
