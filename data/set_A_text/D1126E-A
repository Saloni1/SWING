0_0	0.15047828	Arriving in Baghdad Sunday for a farewell visit, President Bush staunchly defended a war that has taken far more time, money and lives than anticipated, saying the conflict "has not been easy" but was necessary for U.S. security, Iraqi stability and "world peace."
0_1	0.25150557	But during a press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki, Bush received a taste of the immense resentment many Iraqis feel toward his policies: Just after Bush finished his remarks and said "Thank you" in Arabic, an Iraqi journalist took off his shoes and hurled them both at Bush, one after the other.
0_2	0.1076995	The incident lent an air of chaos and farce to a trip intended to highlight improving security conditions in the war-torn country.
0_3	0.26194388	"This is a farewell kiss!" the man, identified as Muntadar al- Zaidi, a reporter with the Cairo-based network Al Baghdadia Television, yelled as he threw the shoes.
0_4	0.20269795	Bush had to duck out of the way, and narrowly missed being hit, according to on-scene reports.
0_5	0.10448941	Al-Maliki reached out his hand to shield the president.
0_6	0.11300072	Zaidi started to yell "Dog, dog!" as he was surrounded by security agents, who tackled him to the floor and began to beat him.
0_7	0.1433178	Zaidi was later removed from the ornate room where the press conference was taking place.
0_8	0.1081426	Bush was not injured and joked about the incident.
0_9	0.4731121	"All I can report is it is a size 10," he said.
0_10	0.11786153	Zaidi was seated in the second row of seats, about 12 feet from Bush's lectern.
0_11	0.065010746	Zaidi, colleagues said, was kidnapped by Shiite militiamen last year and was later released.
0_12	0.10187108	Throwing a shoe at someone is considered the worst possible insult in Iraq, and is meant to show extreme disrespect.
0_13	0.10151494	Bush landed in Iraq Sunday under a veil of secrecy for his fourth and presumably final stop as president in a war zone that will be central to defining his turbulent presidency.

0_15	0.1211789	Bush was scheduled to meet with U.S. troops and Iraqi leaders about a recently completed security agreement, which calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces by 2011.
0_16	0.10144326	After meeting with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani at Salam Palace, Bush hailed the security agreement as "a reminder of our friendship and as a way forward to help the Iraqi people realize the blessings of a free society."
0_17	0.093104403	"The work hasn't been easy, but it has been necessary for American security, Iraqi hope, and world peace," Bush said, adding: "I am just so grateful that I had a chance to come back to Iraq before my presidency ended."
0_18	0.08823951	Bush's praise for the security agreement is particularly remarkable given that the U.S. administration spent years dismissing proposals for withdrawal timelines as dangerous admissions of defeat.
0_19	0.08758139	The agreement came after months of hard bargaining by Iraqi leaders, who insisted on a firm date for the removal of U.S. troops.
0_20	0.11541383	Bush and his aides characterize the agreement as a sign of improvement, and Bush said earlier this week that the fight in Iraq was nearing "a successful end."
0_21	0.088684728	His last visit comes against a backdrop of declining violence across Iraq, which the administration attributes to a buildup of thousands of reinforcements last year.
0_22	0.090799749	U.S. commanders have also credited the lower levels of violence to a ceasefire by anti- American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and to the Sunni Awakening, in which former insurgents and tribal leaders turned their weapons against Sunni extremists.
0_23	0.092085642	Yet attacks have continued and many areas in Iraq remain unstable, particularly in the north.
0_24	0.095336409	Last week, at least 57 Iraqis were killed in a suicide attack at a popular restaurant outside of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
0_25	0.096892935	The improved overall conditions in Iraq have had little discernible impact on the mood of the American public, which has said in polls that the invasion was a mistake.
0_26	0.095989476	Bush offered in a recent interview that faulty intelligence that preceded the war was his "biggest regret," though he declined to say whether he would have changed course if he had known Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction.
0_27	0.1063341	Bush previously traveled to Iraq in November 2003, June 2006 and September 2007.
0_28	0.097839118	As with those trips, his fourth was surrounded in secrecy.
0_29	0.09963765	Bush's office had distributed a bogus public schedule that said he would attend a "Christmas in Washington" event Sunday night at the National Building Museum.
0_30	0.10149485	A group of 13 journalists picked by the White House accompanied Bush and senior aides on the trip.
0_31	0.096560549	They were told about the trip on Friday but were restricted to telling only a spouse and supervisor about the plans.

1_1	0.13187972	Later, Iraqi journalists identified him as Muntadar al-Zeidi, a correspondent for Al- Baghdadia, a satellite TV channel that broadcasts from Cairo, Egypt.
1_2	0.067124476	Colleagues said al-Zeidi has done extensive reporting from Sadr City, the stronghold of anti-U.S. cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and was rescued by Sadr's Mahdi Army militia after being abducted by an unidentified group in November 2007.
1_3	0.2094926	Al-Zeidi was one of several Iraqi journalists attending the Sunday evening news conference inside Baghdad's heavily secured International Zone.
1_4	0.14211454	His outburst came without warning as Bush and al-Maliki prepared to answer questions.
1_5	0.11056326	The first shoe flew over the heads of other journalists and might have hit Bush square in the face had the lame-duck president not ducked.
1_6	0.13527937	"This is a gift from the Iraqis.
1_7	0.154626	This is the farewell kiss, you dog," the man said, according to a pool translation.
1_8	0.10037874	Seconds later, the journalist hurled his other shoe with similar precision as another Iraqi journalist reached over in an attempt to stop him.
1_9	0.10884979	"This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq," he said.
1_10	0.10987948	After being pinned to the ground, the shoe-thrower was dragged out by security guards.

2_9	0.13306953	It was at that point the journalist stood up and threw his shoe.
2_10	0.11479398	Bush ducked, and it narrowly missed his head.

3_8	0.27298639	"If you want the facts, it was a size 10," he joked.
3_9	0.18149724	The shoe attack came as Bush and al-Maliki were about to shake hands.
3_10	0.13621413	The assailant -- later identified as television correspondent Muntadar al-Zeidi -- leapt from his chair and hurled his footwear at the president, who was about 20 feet away.

3_12	0.072430859	The crowd descended on al-Zeidi, who works for Al-Baghdadiya television, an Iraqi-owned station based in Cairo, Egypt.
3_13	0.13258814	He was wrestled to the ground by security officials and then hauled away, moaning as they departed the room.

5_36	0.092752004	But when it came to the terrorists, Bush spoke with the cool ruthlessness of a dissident shareholder at an annual meeting.

5_44	0.097450239	``Al-Qaida's going to fight us wherever we are," he said.
5_45	0.091004726	``They want to establish a caliphate."
5_46	0.097001843	When NBC's Gregory asked Bush to explain why he's ``still a credible messenger on the war," the answer eventually arrived again at the al-Qaida threat: ``They're dangerous.

5_48	0.097513589	After several such iterations of the threat, the Times' Rutenberg asked Bush to be philosophical about bin Laden.
5_49	0.099698388	``What do you think your own reaction would have been five years ago had you been told that toward the end of your term he would still be at large with that kind of capability, from Iraq no less?"

6_1	0.17070626	President Bush on Sunday made a valedictory visit to Iraq, the country that will largely define his legacy, but the trip will more likely be remembered for the unscripted moment when an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at Bush's head and denounced him on live television as a "dog" who had delivered death and sorrow here from nearly six years of war.
6_2	0.22110742	The drama unfolded shortly after Bush appeared at a news conference in Baghdad with Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki to highlight the newly adopted security agreement between the United States and Iraq.
6_3	0.12551958	That agreement includes a commitment to withdraw all American forces by the end of 2011.
6_4	0.20704985	The Iraqi journalist, Muntader al-Zaidi, 28, a correspondent for Al Baghdadia, an independent Iraqi station, stood up about 12 feet from Bush and shouted in Arabic: "This is a gift from the Iraqis; this is the farewell kiss, you dog!"
6_5	0.26341909	He then threw a shoe at Bush, who ducked and narrowly avoided it.
6_6	0.16652956	As stunned security agents and guards, officials and journalists watched, al-Zaidi then threw his other shoe, shouting in Arabic, "This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq!"
6_7	0.17472573	That shoe also narrowly missed Bush as al-Maliki stuck a hand in front of the president's face to help shield him.
6_8	0.17096718	Chaos immediately ensued as a scrum of al-Maliki's security agents jumped on the man, wrestled him to the floor and hustled him out of the ornate room where the news conference was taking place.
6_9	0.056689021	They kicked him and beat him until "he was crying like a woman," said Mohammed Taher, a reporter for Afaq, a station owned by the Dawa Party, which is led by al-Maliki.
6_10	0.075195432	Zaidi was then detained on unspecified charges.
6_11	0.14180348	Other Iraqi journalists in the front row of the news conference publicly apologized to Bush, who was uninjured and tried to brush off the incident by making a joke.
6_12	0.21722855	"All I can report is it is a size 10," he said, continuing to take a few questions and noting the apologies.
6_13	0.084152188	He also called the incident a sign of democracy in the country, saying, "That's what people do in a free society, draw attention to themselves," as the man's screaming could be heard outside.
6_14	0.091039715	But the moment clearly unnerved the aides of al-Maliki and some of the Americans in Bush's entourage, partly because it was televised and may have revealed a security lapse in the so-called Green Zone, the most heavily secured part of Baghdad.
6_15	0.105233	Dana Perino, the White press secretary, was visibly distraught, and NBC News reported she had been struck in the face by a microphone in the chaos.
6_16	0.077249059	The shoe-throwing incident also punctuated Bush's visit -- his fourth -- in a deeply symbolic way, reflecting the conflicted views in Iraq of a man who had toppled Saddam Hussein, ordered the occupation of the country and brought it the kind of freedoms unthinkable under Saddam's rule but at enormous costs.
6_17	0.11739852	Hitting someone with a shoe is considered the supreme insult in Iraq.
6_18	0.077506519	It means that the target is even lower than the shoe, which is always on the ground and dirty.
6_19	0.077150997	Crowds of people hurled their shoes at the giant statue of Saddam that once stood in Baghad's Firdos Square before helping U.S. Marines to pull it down April 9, 2003, the day the capital fell.
6_20	0.09153467	More recently, a far bigger crowd comprised of Iraqis who had opposed the security agreement did the same with an effigy of Bush in the same square, flinging their shoes at it before burning it.
6_21	0.063820105	Al-Zaidi's motivations in carrying out a potentially career- ending act were unclear, but friends described him as a devoted journalist.
6_22	0.072385079	"He was committed to his job and after training in Lebanon became chief of correspondents about a month ago," said Haider Nassar, who worked with him at Baghdadia.
6_23	0.089635052	"He had bad feelings about the coalition forces," said Nassar, referring to the U.S.-led foreign military forces in Iraq.
6_24	0.099622605	Nassar also said al-Zaidi had asked to cover the news conference, since he was the chief correspondent.
6_25	0.14213267	Another friend said al-Zaidi often ended his reports by saying "Reporting from occupied Baghdad, this is Muntader al-Zaidi."
6_26	0.12354651	Like many Iraqi reporters at the news conference, Nassar said he did not think this was an effective way for al-Zaidi to make his points.
6_27	0.08174243	"This is so silly; it's just the behavior of an individual.
6_28	0.091187751	He destroyed his future," he said.
6_29	0.087169462	The television channel broadcast a request for al-Zaidi's release in the name of democracy and freedom of speech.
6_30	0.088453548	"Any procedure against Muntader will remind us of the behavior of the dictatorship and their violent actions, random detentions and mass graves," the channel said.
6_31	0.093392661	"Baghdadia TV channel also demands that the international and Iraqi television organizations cooperate in seeking the release of Muntader al-Zaidi."
6_32	0.096304555	Shortly before 10 p.m., Bush left the Green Zone by helicopter to Camp Victory, where he was greeted with cheers and whoops from hundreds of troops inside the enormous rotunda of the Al Faw palace.
6_33	0.093419256	Speaking at a lectern beneath an enormous American flag that nearly reached the domed ceiling, he praised this generation of soldiers and reflected on the sacrifice of those who had died.
6_34	0.094425258	He called the increased deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq last year, a strategy known as the surge, which is credited with helping reduce violence here, "one of the greatest successes in the history of the United States military."
6_35	0.097706239	Bush's arrival in Iraq during daylight hours had been one measure of progress; his first visit on Thanksgiving Day 2003 took place entirely at night.
6_36	0.095990911	As with previous visits -- in November 2003, June 2006 and September 2007 -- preparations for the visit were secretive and carried out with ruse.
6_37	0.10509589	The White House schedule for Sunday had Bush attending the "Christmas in Washington" performance at the National Building Museum in downtown Washington.
6_38	0.098621208	Instead, he left the White House by car Saturday night, arriving at Andrews Air Force base at 9 p.m. to board Air Force One.
6_39	0.095456937	A dozen journalists accompanying him were only told of the trip Friday and allowed to tell only a superior and a spouse -- and only in person.
6_40	0.11122234	At his news conference with al-Maliki, Bush described the security agreement as a landmark, signaling a new era in the war he began in the spring of 2003.
6_41	0.10707601	"There is still more work to be done," the president said about the war, but with the security agreement and the "the courage of the Iraqi people, and the Iraqi troops and the American troops and civilian personnel, it is decisively on its way to be won."
6_42	0.10550988	Al-Maliki's partnership with Bush and his backing of the security agreement are unlikely to help him much once Bush leaves office.
6_43	0.098611485	Although a majority of the Iraqi parliament approved the agreement, on the street, Iraqis have mixed views.
6_44	0.097385621	Many distrust any agreement made with an occupying power and while Bush is appreciated for having overthrown Saddam, he is widely blamed for the violence that raged in the years after the war, which forced more than a million Iraqis to flee and killed tens of thousands of civilians.
6_45	0.09763957	Still, Bush's stalwart support for al-Maliki -- after an initial period when the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, expressed doubts about him -- has been a bulwark against domestic political forces who sought to topple him.
6_46	0.098458817	With the U.S. president's term ending, Iraqi politicians from parties other than al-Maliki's have been discussing whether to force the prime minister out with a no-confidence vote.
6_47	0.098196402	This is not the first time his ouster has been discussed, but with U.S.power in Iraq on the wane and troops beginning to draw down in earnest, it seems a more serious threat.
6_48	0.10127537	Weighing against it happening, however, is that there is no agreement on al-Maliki's successor or on how to divide Cabinet posts.
6_49	0.10081523	The posts are split among the political blocs that control the parliament, and they would be loath to give up anything they have unless they were assured that they would get another position that was at least as good.

7_1	0.62779043	BAGHDAD, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.
7_2	0.26586184	Muntadhar al-Zaidi, reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and threw his two shoes one by one at the president, who ducked and thus narrowly missed being struck, raising chaos in the hall in Baghdad's heavily fortified green Zone.
7_3	0.11984147	"This is a farewell kiss, dog," said Zaidi.
7_4	0.12933967	Several security members wrestled the man to the floor and then dragged him out of the hall as he was screaming.
7_5	0.16456562	However, Bush tried to show himself calm and said "all I can report is it is a size 10."
7_6	0.098020182	"I didn't feel the least threatened by it," Bush also said, adding that "it doesn't bother me" before he and Maliki leave the conference room.
