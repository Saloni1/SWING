2_15	0.7272727272727273	Other conservation groups, however, including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, oppose delisting.
2_16	0.09090909090909091	While the number of bears is healthy, they say, some of the bears' critical food sources, like the white bark pine nut, are in steep decline, which could force the bear to leave the park in search of food.
2_17	0.42857142857142855	And removing protection, they say, would not allow the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to halt development in a crucial grizzly habitat.
2_18	0.17391304347826086	"If you don't protect the habitat, it doesn't matter how many bears you have -- you'll lose them," said Lance F. Craighead, executive director of the Craighead Environmental Research Institute, in Bozeman, who maps grizzly bear habitat.

4_0	0.75	The Bush administration on Tuesday is to take the first step toward removing Yellowstone's grizzly bears, a living icon of the American West, from the nation's endangered species list.
4_1	0.47368421052631576	The proposal to de-list grizzly bears in the area surrounding Yellowstone National Park, which has alarmed some environmentalists, highlights the contrasting views of the 32-year-old Endangered Species Act.

4_3	0.0967741935483871	If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current ``threatened'' status -- a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.
4_4	0.07692307692307693	The government would continue to monitor how state and federal authorities manage the land where the bears live to ensure their survival.

4_10	0.0	The bears range over nearly 9 million acres in and around the national park, she said, but the administration's proposal only covers a six million-acre habitat.
4_11	0.3157894736842105	``We would love to see the grizzly bear de-listed, but it's not ready,'' Wilcox said, adding that one-third of the bears' current habitat could be opened to drilling, logging and human development.

4_18	0.0	Grizzlies are thriving in Alaska, where more than 30,000 of them live.
4_19	0.06666666666666667	No one questions that Yellowstone's grizzlies have rebounded over the past three decades since they were listed -- the population has been growing at a rate of 4 to 7 percent a year for several years -- in part because state and federal officials abolished trash dumps that used to lure bears and bring them into dangerous contact with humans.
4_20	0.0	But the recent revival has also sparked conflict with nearby residents as the bears venture out of the national park.
4_21	0.2222222222222222	Dominic Domenici, the Fish and Wildlife Service resident agent in charge of enforcement for Montana and Wyoming, said there ``are more conflicts now between elk hunters and bears,'' in part because the whitebark pine seeds grizzlies need are in shorter supply now due to a beetle infestation induced by warming climate.
4_22	0.05555555555555555	Some environmentalists say the decline of whitebark pine is yet another reason why the grizzlies should remain listed as threatened, since the seeds are closely linked to female bears' fecundity.
4_23	0.09090909090909091	But National Wildlife Federation senior wildlife biologist Sterling Miller, who spent 21 years studying grizzlies in Alaska, said the time has come to take Yellowstone's bears off the list.

8_17	0.42857142857142855	Once Endangered Species Act protections are removed, a host of new safeguards will ensure grizzly populations will not decline, Servheen said.

8_21	0.0	The fact that the bears have rebounded, critics say, doesn't necessarily mean they are recovered.

8_34	0.0	Federal bear biologists contend the rust is moving more slowly in Yellowstone than in northwest Montana and that the trees have co-evolved with mountain pine beetles for thousands of years.
8_35	0.2222222222222222	"We don't know if whitebark pine will decline," said Chuck Schwartz, a U.S. Geological Survey researcher leading the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team.

8_42	0.23529411764705882	In late summer and fall, grizzly bears follow an urge to gorge in order to store enough fat to survive hibernation, a condition called hyperphagy.
8_43	0.0	A 350-pound female needs to average 18,000 kilocalories, or the equivalent of 30 Big Macs a day, according to Mattson.

8_46	0.0	Until the 1970s, watching dump-diving grizzlies was a popular attraction at Yellowstone.
8_47	0.0	When the dumps were closed, hungry bears invaded park campgrounds and more than 225 had to be killed.
8_48	0.0	That, critics of delisting say, serves as a cautionary tale.
8_49	0.0	There are already fewer native cutthroat trout swimming up spawning streams, where bears hunt them, because they're being gobbled up in Yellowstone Lake by illegally introduced lake trout.
8_50	0.1111111111111111	In years when whitebarks naturally produce fewer nuts, more Yellowstone grizzlies move to the park's edges, where they find hunters' elk carcasses.
8_51	0.0	Foraging on the edge of the park is dangerous for bears because that's where people live.
8_52	0.0	Humans are responsible for 85 percent of Yellowstone bear deaths, said Schwartz.

8_54	0.0	In fact, the six-year average of female bear deaths exceeded the maximum allowed by the recovery plan in 2004 and 2005, according to federal data.
8_55	0.0	The deaths fall within new mortality limits that are based on more thorough population estimates now being substituted for the old ones, federal managers say.
8_56	0.0	Dealing with bears near the recovery zone boundary will be the toughest challenge for state and federal biologists, Schwartz said.
8_57	0.0	Problem bears have to be removed quickly so the public will accept living with the rest.
8_58	0.14285714285714285	"The Yellowstone ecosystem has a fixed amount of habitat," Schwartz said.

9_12	0.28	Given this political reality, officials from the National Wildlife Federation say they have concluded that the long effort to rescue grizzlies in and around Yellowstone National Park should be publicized for what it is: a resounding success and a perfect example of how the Endangered Species Act can work.
9_13	0.0	When grizzlies were listed as threatened in 1975, there were about 200 to 250 of them in the Yellowstone area.
