0_1	0.084597372	An international study led by Johns Hopkins University suggests on Monday that the rate of HIV-related dementia is so high in sub-Saharan Africa that HIV dementia along with Alzheimer's disease and dementia from strokes may be among the most common forms of dementia in the world.
0_2	0.083595074	In the first study of HIV dementia on the African continent using rigorous neurological and neuropsychological tests, 31 percent of a small but presumably representative group of HIV-positive patients in Uganda were found to have HIV dementia, according to Ned Sacktor, M.D., a Johns Hopkins neurologist and senior author of a multi-institutional study that will be published Jan. 29 in Neurology.
0_3	0.033572657	HIV dementia is defined as memory, learning, behavioral and motor disabilities that interfere with normal daily life and in extreme cases lead to total disability and a bedridden state.
0_4	0.083970651	Unlike Alzheimer's- and stroke-induced dementia, HIV dementia is treatable and potentially reversible with the same antiretroviral medication that is used to treat the infection.
0_5	0.046704447	Treatment can even restore completely normal cognitive function to some of those affected.
0_6	0.069071545	The study looked at 178 subjects in Kampala, Uganda, from September 2003 to January 2004.
0_7	0.077829483	Seventy-eight were HIV-positive patients recruited from the Infectious Disease Clinic in Mulago Hospital, Makerere University, and 100 were HIV-negative individuals recruited from the AIDs Information Center who were used to obtain normative data for the cognitive tests.
0_8	0.095684968	In diagnosing HIV dementia, researchers looked at medical history and the results of a series of comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological tests and functional assessments.
0_9	0.093710327	"Clearly, large-scale testing would have to be conducted before we know the global reach of HIV dementia, but this study sends a clear message that it exists in high proportions in sub-Saharan Africa and is an under-recognized condition that needs to be studied and treated," Sacktor says.
0_10	0.10497182	Of the estimated 40 million adults and children worldwide who are living with HIV infection, an estimated 27 million live in sub- Saharan Africa, according to Sacktor.
0_11	0.097277801	"If the rate we saw in our study translates across sub-Saharan Africa, we're looking at more than 8,000,000 people in this region with HIV dementia," says Sacktor.
0_12	0.10037146	Sacktor says an extremely high rate of HIV dementia in Africa and other poor regions of the world adds enormously to the social and economic burden of their populations and governments.
0_13	0.097707986	Dementia not only disrupts jobs and adds to the cost of care, but also interferes with a patient's ability to adhere to a regular course of antiretroviral medication, thus increasing the risk of drug resistance.
0_14	0.097848674	"We hope studies like these will shed additional light on the devastating problem of HIV in resource-limited countries like Uganda and encourage more programs that bring much-needed medication to these poor regions of the world," Sacktor says.
1_0	0.19548034	A study carried out by British researchers has revealed that a drug designed to combat genital herpes can reduce levels of HIV in the blood by 70 percent and also appears to reduce levels of HIV in the genital tract.
1_1	0.13430244	Researchers of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, had the findings after having carried out a small trial in Africa, New Scientist reported Thursday on its website.
1_2	0.13597142	The researchers led by Philippe Mayaud recruited 140 women infected with both HIV and herpes in the West African nation of Burkina Faso and gave half of the women valacyclovir and the other half women placebo pills for three months.
1_3	0.079068267	The researchers found that copies of HIV in those who received valacyclovir had dropped from 25,000 copies per milliliter of blood to 8,000 per milliliter - a 70 percent reduction and levels of HIV found in the blood of women who received the placebo, by comparison, had increased slightly on average.
1_4	0.094810161	The women who received valacyclovir also had half as many copies of HIV in their genital tracts compared to those who received the placebo, suggesting that valacyclovir has the potential to reduce the spread of HIV, Mayaud said.
1_5	0.088096959	This is the same effect one would expect if the women had been given an anti-HIV drug such as Zidovudine (AZT), according to Mayaud.
1_6	0.11202544	The herpes medication, valacyclovir, and other herpes drugs, might dramatically reduce the spread of HIV, according to the researchers.
1_7	0.099635723	Researchers believe that valacyclovir indirectly reduces HIV infection by decreasing copies of the herpes virus and note that untreated herpes can cause lesions in the genital region, which subsequently attract a type of immune cell that harbors HIV.
1_8	0.10174758	Mayaud stressed the need for long-term studies of valacyclovir' s effect on HIV infection.

2_1	0.064338105	The top priority in Africa should be getting people basic health care and not just dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, an African Union commissioner said.
2_2	0.024746241	Bience Gawanas, the AU's commissioner for social affairs, joined members of African-based HIV/AIDS organizations, U.N. delegates and staff on Friday for an informal briefing on HIV/AIDS.
2_3	0.066660119	The panel echoed a need for general health services that some expressed would improve treatment and prevention of the disease.
2_4	0.038686756	"We should go back to the basics: that primary health care is what Africa needs," Gawanas said.
2_5	0.039091657	"You cannot focus on one issue at the exclusion of others."
2_6	0.22379249	Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa became infected with HIV, and 2.1 million people died.
2_7	0.079641277	The region is home to over 60 percent of all people living with HIV.
2_8	0.10035002	But Africa also struggles with high rates of tuberculosis and malaria infection.
2_9	0.080118599	U.N.-led efforts to solve the problems one by one lose effectiveness as they encounter complex maladies among people in Africa, Gawanas said.
2_10	0.08526154	"The U.N. system approach says look at AIDS and TB, then look at something else," she said.
2_11	0.088844217	"The body cannot choose... to get help from one agency or another if it has more than one disease," Gawanas said.
2_12	0.093038083	Prof. Babatunde Osotimehin, chairman of Nigeria's National Action Committee on AIDS, said Africa has suffered a "decay" in its infrastructure.
2_13	0.096153036	Building health care systems is among its top challenges, he said.
2_14	0.096843381	A focus on treatment programs is drawing attention away from prevention strategies and general health care services could correct the balance, Osotimehin said.
2_15	0.099452731	"Access is not just about drugs, it's about services," he said.
2_16	0.096425848	But he also said that manufacturing medication used to treat HIV/AIDS is sparse in Africa and the continent needs to increase its own production because "HIV is going to be with us for a very long time."
2_17	0.098037898	Gawanas said "HIV has a woman's face," referring to the prevalence of the disease among women compared to men, and that dealing with social issues is also among top priorities in the ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS.
3_0	0.21568827	Trials showing that male circumcision more than halves the risk of HIV infection are published in The Lancet on Friday, giving the seal of approval to calls for circumcision to be cautiously launched as an AIDS prevention strategy.
3_1	0.11552825	The trials, conducted in Kenya and Uganda and earlier in South Africa, found that men who were uncircumcised were twice as likely to catch the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared with circumcised counterparts.
3_2	0.065297853	The data were so dramatic that the trials in Kenya and Uganda were halted ahead of schedule, for it would have been ethically wrong to continue them.
3_3	0.10019053	The trials' results were announced by their researchers last year.
3_4	0.13843783	But Friday's publication in the peer-assessed Lancet of the Kenya and Uganda research is the medical community's de-facto validation of the findings, and enshrines circumcision's place in the war against AIDS.
3_5	0.12541731	"We have proof of a permanent intervention that can reduce the risk of HIV infection in men, which is positive news about prevention after past and current disappointments," said a commentary by Marie-Louise Newell and Till Barnighausen of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and the Harvard School of Public Health.
3_6	0.084664067	They calculate that in KwaZulu-Natal province, where HIV incidence is very high but circumcision rates very low, 35,000 new infections could have been prevented in 2007 alone if the 2.5 million men there had been circumcised.
3_7	0.074405223	In addition to being preventive, circumcision also carries cost benefits.
3_8	0.10863223	The operation is cheap, whereas treatment for HIV infection entails a lifelong dependence on expensive drugs.
3_9	0.062715872	But Newell and Barnighausen join other experts in saying that the urge to swiftly implement circumcision should be leavened with caution.
3_10	0.077259986	Governments and doctors have to tread carefully in advising circumcision, they said.
3_11	0.076069281	In some cultures, circumcision is considered a rite of passage to adulthood and a symbol of manhood; in others, it is considered an emasculation.
3_12	0.084512085	In addition, the operation has to be conducted in sterile conditions by trained personnel, and this will require resources for awareness campaigns and set up medical facilities.
3_13	0.086778224	Most importantly, reduction of risk is not the same as elimination of risk, which means that circumcised men should still be encouraged to wear a condom.
3_14	0.091598212	"The emerging truth is that no single approach alone will be able to stem the spread of HIV," The Lancet said in an editorial.
3_15	0.095000338	Botched operations and the temptations of unsafe sex could squander a historic opportunity, it said.
3_16	0.10663967	In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS welcomed publication of the trials in Kenya and Uganda.
3_17	0.12342625	"Male circumcision has major potential for the prevention of HIV infection," said Kevin De Cock, director of the WHO's HIV/AIDS department.
3_18	0.097001806	WHO and UNAIDS have convened an international meeting in early March to examine the results of the new trials and assess their impact on AIDS policies.
3_19	0.097263337	The theory behind circumcision's protective effect is that the foreskin has a very thin epithelium, or lining, and easily suffers minor abrasions during intercourse.
3_20	0.095717512	These microscopic cuts make it easier for the AIDS virus to enter the man's bloodstream.
3_21	0.098291364	Another mooted reason is that the foreskin is rich in so-called Langerhans cells whose surface configuration makes it easy for the AIDS virus to latch on to them.
4_0	0.078010147	17:14:29 UTC
4_1	0.098241893	Scientists say conclusive data shows there is no question circumcision reduces men's chances of catching HIV by up to 60 percent -- a finding experts are hailing as a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS.
4_2	0.021945385	Now, the question is how to put that fact to work to combat AIDS across Africa.
4_3	0.063567587	The findings first were announced in December, when initial results from two major trials -- in Kenya and Uganda -- showed promising links between circumcision and HIV transmission.
4_4	0.071216445	However, those trials were deemed so definitive that the tests were halted early.
4_5	0.096285004	The results were confirmed by further tests carried out by the United States' National Institutes of Health and published Friday in The Lancet.
4_6	0.23011961	"This is an extraordinary development," said Dr. Kevin de Cock, director of the World Health Organization's AIDS department.
4_7	0.10502702	"Circumcision is the most potent intervention in HIV prevention that has been described."
4_8	0.16340789	Circumcision has long been suspected of reducing men's susceptibility to HIV infection because the cells in the foreskin of the penis are especially vulnerable to the virus.
4_9	0.12514185	Now, a modeling study projects that in the next decade, male circumcision could prevent 2 million AIDS infections and 300,000 deaths.
4_10	0.24743906	Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa became infected with HIV, and 2.1 million people died.
4_11	0.084396627	Experts say the breakthrough is a significant one on par with the identification of the virus and the use of lifesaving combination drug therapy.
4_12	0.11414684	The two U.S. studies confirm similar results from an earlier trial in South Africa.
4_13	0.099239596	Given the recent failure of a microbicide trial in Africa and India, and the ongoing difficulties in developing an AIDS vaccine, the potential of circumcision as a new weapon against HIV has become even more significant.
4_14	0.055996866	But they caution solid evidence is not justification for mass circumcisions.
4_15	0.087747503	African health systems are already overburdened.
4_16	0.062442416	Circumcision requires much more planning than, for example, an immunization campaign.
4_17	0.064213484	"It's a tricky one, but it's something we're going to have to move on," said Dr. Catherine Hankins, a scientific adviser at UNAIDS.
4_18	0.081733336	"Male circumcision is such a sensitive religious and cultural issue that we need to be careful," she said.
4_19	0.082239958	Several African countries have already met with U.N. agencies to explore new strategies for increasing circumcision services.
4_20	0.079392837	Swaziland, for instance, recently experimented with a series of "Circumcision Saturdays," where existing health care facilities, normally closed on weekends, were opened by local doctors to circumcise approximately 40 men a day on certain Saturdays.
4_21	0.086765562	Providing circumcisions across Africa would not be the first time surgical procedures have been adopted by public health campaigns.
4_22	0.095826295	"Cataract surgeries have been carried out extremely efficiently to prevent blindness worldwide," said Dr. Richard Hayes, an AIDS expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
4_23	0.087598842	In some places, the cataract surgeries are performed by trained paramedics.
4_24	0.092608445	In recent years, the fight against the AIDS pandemic has focused on the provision of lifesaving drugs.
4_25	0.090079903	The circumcision data gives prevention, rather than treatment, renewed emphasis.
4_26	0.092926645	"Treating people with antiretrovirals is completely unsustainable unless we can turn off the tap of infection," said Hayes.
4_27	0.09421149	While circumcision may offer new hope, it is not a cure for the epidemic.
4_28	0.095931466	"This is an additional tool, and it must not replace other interventions," said de Cock, who added that there will be no push for universal circumcision.
4_29	0.10005972	"There is no one size fits all solution for AIDS."
4_30	0.096733351	Together with the United Nations AIDS agency, WHO is convening a meeting in Switzerland in early March to evaluate the circumcision data, and to decide on the next steps in slowing the AIDS pandemic.
4_31	0.10106712	In the Kenyan study, 1,391 circumcised men were compared to 1,393 who were not.
4_32	0.097898841	And in Uganda, 2,474 circumcised men were compared to 2,522 men who were not.
4_33	0.097328439	After tracking the men for two years, scientists found that circumcised men were 51 to 60 percent less likely to contract HIV than their uncircumcised counterparts.
4_34	0.097283341	Since the studies were stopped, all the men have been offered the opportunity to be circumcised.
4_35	0.10249217	And all the men were warned not to lapse into sexually risky behavior, such as abandoning condom use.
4_36	0.097446438	Scientists theorize that women would benefit indirectly from lower HIV prevalence in men, and a study is currently ongoing in Uganda to determine this.
4_37	0.097994696	In areas where HIV is spread primarily through heterosexual sex, such as sub-Saharan Africa, male circumcision could theoretically slash the infection rate in half.
4_38	0.099234299	It is unknown whether circumcision would be equally effective in concentrated AIDS epidemics, as in Asia and eastern Europe, where AIDS primarily strikes gay men and drug users.

5_1	0.16800761	Treating genital herpes can also help keep the AIDS virus under control in women with both infections, and might reduce the spread of HIV as well, the first major study to test this strategy suggests.
5_2	0.18303565	Many people with HIV are also infected with the herpes type 2 virus, and scientists have long known that herpes sores on the genitals can make it easier to become infected with the AIDS virus and could increase the risk of transmitting HIV to others.
5_3	0.12782108	In the latest study, conducted in Africa and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, women who took the herpes drug valacyclovir had less HIV in their blood and in their genital secretions.
5_4	0.1296804	The study did not look at whether the drug, sold as Valtrex by GlaxoSmithKline PLC, actually reduces transmission of the AIDS virus.
5_5	0.10904887	However, scientists generally have found that the more virus someone has, the greater the risk of transmission.
5_6	0.11345698	Doctors have been looking for novel ways to treat and prevent HIV infection, particularly in poor countries where few can afford modern AIDS drugs and the stigma keeps many from taking them.
5_7	0.116604	Researchers recently found that circumcision lowers the risk of spreading HIV, and they hope the same will prove true of treating herpes.
5_8	0.075279975	"It does open some potential avenues to slowing down the HIV epidemic," said Dr. Lawrence Corey, a leading herpes researcher at the University of Washington who had no role in the study but has received research grants from Glaxo.
5_9	0.16753626	There are 40,000 new HIV infections in the U.S. each year and 4.3 million new cases worldwide.
5_10	0.082704675	Previous studies have shown that herpes infections can triple a person's chance of acquiring HIV and can make HIV-positive individuals more infectious.
5_11	0.11962526	In the study, 140 women from the West African nation of Burkina Faso who were infected with the both the herpes and AIDS viruses received either valacyclovir or dummy pills for three months.
5_12	0.083941637	Participants were not taking other AIDS medications.
5_13	0.068995655	Doctors took vaginal swabs and drew blood samples twice a week to measure HIV levels.
5_14	0.086064992	Those who took the drug ended up with less HIV in the bloodstream, with their count dropping from an average 20,000 virus copies per milliliter of blood to 8,000 copies.
5_15	0.083683282	The placebo group saw their HIV levels spike, from an average of 50,000 virus copies per milliliter of blood to 63,000.
5_16	0.095533957	The treatment group was also less likely to have HIV in their genital tract -- 13 percent had detectable virus levels during each visit, compared with 27 percent in the placebo group.
5_17	0.10177341	The study involved researchers from France, England and Burkina Faso and was funded by the French national AIDS research agency, ANRS.
5_18	0.11280267	One of the study's authors, Dr. Philippe Mayaud of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, called for more research on herpes control methods, including the development of a herpes vaccine.
5_19	0.092142465	Mayaud has received research support from Glaxo.
5_20	0.095680638	A larger study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is under way that aims to be the definitive word on whether treating herpes patients with acyclovir, the first herpes drug, can slow down HIV transmission.
5_21	0.097643776	Some AIDS specialists said it is unlikely herpes drugs will be the first line of defense against AIDS.
5_22	0.096906093	However, they said such treatment could be useful in preventing HIV transmission in Third World countries without access to modern AIDS drugs.
5_23	0.098284095	"If, heaven forbid, we didn't have treatments for HIV, this would be something we would use.
5_24	0.098552455	Fortunately, we have much better therapies to treat HIV," said Dr. Michael Saag, director of the AIDS Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

8_7	0.068176185	``This creates a huge challenge in terms of infection control, especially in settings where a high numbers of HIV-positive individuals are converging," such as hospitals, Weyer said.
8_8	0.058358537	Doctors have seen sporadic cases for decades, but the XDR form gained attention after the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal province.
8_9	0.10672802	The World Health Organization has reported that the number of countries with XDR tuberculosis has increased from 17 in March to 28 at present.
8_10	0.10180352	Some of the most affected areas include South Africa, South Korea and parts of Eastern Europe, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
8_11	0.081706385	The disease can kill with surprising speed, particularly among HIV patients, whose immune systems are weakened.
8_12	0.089392062	Researchers reported last year that median survival time for patients in one study was 25 days following their diagnosis.
8_13	0.088865383	Weyer said the disease appears in about 10 percent of patients with a less severe form of tuberculosis known as ``multi-drug resistant."
8_14	0.095774365	XDR tuberculosis has appeared in the U.S. but at much lower levels.
8_15	0.10031226	Since 1993, there have been 47 cases in the U.S., resulting in 13 deaths, said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) and TB Prevention.
8_16	0.098015027	The death rate is still six times higher than the typical rate for tuberculosis, he said.
8_17	0.097120867	Resistance testing is widespread in the U.S., but Fenton said the South African cases are a ``wake-up call" for strengthening TB surveillance and prevention.
8_18	0.097786074	He said there are large numbers of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis cases in China, Russia and India, providing more opportunities for the development of XDR tuberculosis.
8_19	0.088721732	``We increasingly live in small world," he said.
8_20	0.099035455	``With foreign travel and migration to the U.S., we have to be very much aware of emerging threats of XDR TB."
9_0	0.18632324	Twenty-two women who took part in recent trials for a gel designed to prevent HIV infection during intercourse have contracted the virus, South Africa's health ministry said on Wednesday.
9_1	0.11628067	The announcement of the number infections comes a day after Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang ordered an investigation into the microbicide clinical trials in the eastern KwaZulu Natal province.
9_2	0.12913567	"We have found that about 22 women from the 604 participants at the trial site in KwaZulu-Natal were infected by the AIDS virus," health spokesman, Sibani Mngadi told AFP.
9_3	0.14781154	"We are investigating whether these women were infected as a result of the use of the microbicide, Ushercell," added Mngadi.
9_4	0.071682084	Tshabalala-Msimang said a thorough investigation was needed to establish if participants in the trial process had been properly informed about the risks.
9_5	0.053718721	"I have asked a thorough investigation into this matter to establish whether the study followed all protocols approved by the Medicine Control Council," she said after a meeting with local scientists.
9_6	0.04891699	"We also are investigating whether the participants were given sufficient information to make informed decisions about their participation."
9_7	0.084797466	It was announced by the World Health Organisation last week that two out of six advanced trials of the vaginal microbicides gels had been stopped for safety reasons.
9_8	0.11687885	Researchers testing cellulose sulphate found that women who used the gel ran a higher risk of HIV infection compared with those who used a dummy lookalike, or placebo.
9_9	0.087376949	As a precaution, another trial using this compound was stopped.
9_10	0.083557114	The cellulose sulphate, also called Ushercell, was in Phase III trials, the final and biggest step in testing a pharmaceutical innovation for safety and effectiveness.
9_11	0.095225148	Apart from South Africa, the trial had also been conducted in India, Uganda and Benin.
9_12	0.092804917	A similar trial involving cellulose sulphate was stopped in Nigeria as a precaution, although there was no data to suggest that there was any risk.
9_13	0.097523728	South Africa's main anti-AIDS lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) said the halting of microbicide trials was a "setback".
9_14	0.097229318	"The termination of the Ushercell trials is a setback for microbicide research," the TAC said in a statement.
9_15	0.097701591	"It is unlikely that a succesful microbicide will be found in the next few years and it is possible that other ongoing microbicide trials will fail.
9_16	0.09820739	"Nevertheless, science advances by learning from failures and ethical trials of the most promising microbicides should continue because the development of a successful microbicide will likely prevent many HIV infections and save many lives."
9_17	0.10920868	South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of HIV infections, with more than 5.5 million out of the overall 47 million population affected by the virus.
