1_9	0.034292025	Dr. D. Holmes Morton, who runs a clinic that serves Amish children, said Thursday that the reports that a 6-year-old had been taken off life- support and taken home to die were accurate "as far as I know."

1_11	0.047067326	National mourning of similar tragedies, such as the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, has been enabled in part by media coverage -- something the Amish generally shun.
1_12	0.11996911	In Lancaster County, there have been prayer services for the Amish school shooting victims at area churches, but the traditional funerals for the girls were closed.
1_13	0.039632021	About 300 to 500 people were expected at each, said funeral director Philip W. Furman.

1_16	0.060845259	The girls' families, Amish neighbors and friends are coping with the slayings by looking inward, relying on themselves and their faith, just as they have for centuries, to get them through what one Amish bishop called "our 9/11," referring to the terror attacks of 2001.

1_21	0.07664366	In just about any other community, a deadly school shooting would have brought demands from civic leaders for tighter gun laws and better security, and the victims' loved ones would have lashed out at the gunman's family or threatened to sue.
1_22	0.085828594	But that is not the Amish way.
1_23	0.16546071	In the aftermath of Monday's violence, the Amish have reached out to the family of the gunman, Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, who committed suicide during the attack in a one-room schoolhouse.
1_24	0.098700072	Dwight Lefever, a Roberts family spokesman, said an Amish neighbor comforted the Roberts family hours after the shooting and extended forgiveness to them.
1_25	0.10678766	Among Roberts' survivors are his wife and three children.

1_27	0.088896834	Roberts' relatives may even receive money from a fund established to help victims and their families, said Kevin King, executive director of Mennonite Disaster services, an agency managing the donations.
1_28	0.090411004	Though the Amish generally do not accept help from outside their community, King quoted an Amish bishop as saying, "We are not asking for funds.
1_29	0.091457612	In fact, it's wrong for us to ask.
1_30	0.092674569	But we will accept them with humility."
1_31	0.11869528	The attack on West Nickel Mines Amish School began Monday morning when Roberts took over the one-room school, sent the adults and boys out and bound the 10 remaining girls at the blackboard.
1_32	0.10030728	He was in the school for about an hour before he shot his hostages and turned the gun on himself as police closed in.
1_33	0.11520236	State police have said Roberts might have been planning to sexually assault the Amish girls but there was no evidence that he actually did.
1_34	0.11868332	Roberts had revealed to his wife in a note left behind the day of the attacks and in a cell phone call from inside the school that he was tormented by memories of molesting two young relatives 20 years ago and dreamed of molesting again.
1_35	0.096150815	But police said Wednesday there was no evidence of any such sexual abuse.
1_36	0.097048854	Investigators spoke to the two relatives Roberts named, who would have been 4 or 5 at the time, and said neither recalled being sexually assaulted by Roberts.

1_38	0.097752436	There is talk among the Amish of tearing down the schoolhouse, which is now boarded up, said Daniel Esh, 57, an Amish artist and woodworker.
