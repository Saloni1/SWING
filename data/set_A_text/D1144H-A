0_0	0.1197268	Curt Stoelting, the chief executive of RC2, concedes that the links in the Thomas &amp; Friends supply chain broke down as it crossed the ocean.
0_1	0.23396896	Since the toy manufacturer based in Oak Brook, Ill., discovered lead paint on a Thomas train in April, RC2 has tried to strengthen its safety safeguards in China, Stoelting said last week in his first interview since the June recall.
0_2	0.046760794	"We've always required our suppliers to follow our safety specifications," Stoelting said.
0_3	0.074399415	"In this incident, those requirements were not met."
0_4	0.22243183	He said RC2 fired both the vendor who made the lead paint and the company that made the wooden toys.
0_5	0.11939453	Unlike Mattel, RC2 does not own any of its factories.
0_6	0.17435335	Instead -- like many United States toy makers operating in China -- the company works with a local network of contract manufacturers, supplemented by 175 RC2 employees stationed there.
0_7	0.14173261	RC2 officials would not provide the names of the paint maker and contract manufacturer responsible for the lead paint problem, but when asked whether those companies would be paying damages to RC2, Stoelting said the company was evaluating its options.
0_8	0.2144744	About 40 percent of the 1.5 million toys that were recalled in June had been returned as of July 11.
0_9	0.11610929	RC2 is mailing customers new toys and reimbursing their postage.
0_10	0.097778522	HIT Entertainment, the owner of the Thomas brand, has not canceled its deal with RC2, nor have other media companies that let RC2 make toys based on their characters, Stoelting said.

0_12	0.098482301	"We're still moving forward with our Thomas product lines," he said.
0_13	0.093158292	"Our goal is to use this incident to really improve our procedures, improve our safeguards."
0_14	0.12183381	Stoelting said that RC2 was now requiring lead testing of every batch of paint used on the Thomas toys.
0_15	0.11063018	And the company has increased the number of times it checks incoming supplies and outgoing toys for problems.
0_16	0.096674373	The company is also hiring an independent auditor to conduct checks, though RC2 executives have not decided whether to release the auditor's reports to the public, Stoelting said.

1_1	0.29424719	Every one of the 24 toys recalled for safety reasons in the United States so far this year, including the enormously popular Thomas and Friends wooden train sets, was manufactured in China, a record that is increasingly causing alarm among consumer advocates, parents and regulators.
1_2	0.24886086	The latest recall, announced last week, involves 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and rail sets -- or about 4 percent of all those sold in the United States over the last two years -- which were coated at a factory in China with potentially poisonous lead paint.
1_3	0.23982708	But just in the last month, a so-called Floating Eyeballs toy made in China was recalled after it was found to be filled with kerosene, sets of toy drums and a toy bear were also recalled because of lead paint and an infant wrist rattle was recalled because of a choking hazard.
1_4	0.12133197	Combined with the recent scares related to Chinese-made pet food, and globally about Chinese-made pharmaceuticals and toothpaste, the string of toy recalls is inspiring demands for stepped up enforcement of toy safety by U.S. regulators and importers, as well as the government and industry in China.
1_5	0.13687025	A spokeswoman for RC2 Corp. of Illinois, the manufacturer of the Thomas Wooden Railway system, declined to comment.
1_6	0.25509886	Overall, the number of products made in China that are being recalled in the United States by the Consumer Product Safety Commission has doubled in the last five years, driving the overall number of recalls in the country to a record level.
1_7	0.12555231	It has meant that China today is responsible for about 60 percent of the overall product recalls, compared to 36 percent in 2000.
1_8	0.14020827	Julie Vallese, a Consumer Product Safety Commission spokeswoman, said the agency recognizes more must be done to prevent the importation of hazardous toys, and other products, from China.
1_9	0.094154265	"It is a big concern.
1_10	0.092834177	And the agency is taking steps to try to address that as quickly as possible," Vallese said.
1_11	0.095828976	"Their businesses will suffer if they don't meet safety standards."
1_12	0.13311543	Much of the rise in China's ranking on the recall list has to do with its corresponding surge as the source of so many products sold in the United States: Toys made in China make up 70 to 80 percent of the toys sold in the country, according to the Toy Industry Association.
1_13	0.10038965	The problem is most acute with low-price, no-name toys that are often sold at dollar stores and other deep discounters, as they are manufactured and sent to the United States often without the involvement of major American toy importers.
2_0	0.41412048	Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, is recalling nearly 1 million toys in the United States on Thursday because the products' surfaces are covered in lead paint.
2_1	0.52750428	According to Mattel, all the toys were made by a contract manufacturer in China.
2_2	0.27471191	The recall, the second-biggest this year involving toys, covers 86 different products, manufactured between April and July 6.
2_3	0.081732179	Many of them feature "Sesame Street" and Nickelodeon characters -- including the Elmo Tub Sub, the Dora the Explorer Backpack, and the Giggle Gabber, a toy shaped like Elmo or Cookie Monster that toddlers shake to hear giggles and funny noises.
2_4	0.14199479	Mattel says it prevented more than two-thirds of the 967,000 affected toys from reaching consumers by contacting retailers, like Wal-Mart, Target and Toys 'R' Us, late last week.
2_5	0.25215208	But more than 300,000 of the tainted toys have been purchased by consumers in the United States.
2_6	0.18448935	A complete list can be found at nytimes.com, as well as the Web sites of Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
2_7	0.2749447	In recent months, factories in China have been sources of poisonous pet food sold in stores in the United States, dangerous car tires, and lead paint on the popular Thomas &amp; Friends wooden toys.
2_8	0.1179674	This is Mattel's 17th recall in 10 years.
2_9	0.19719322	Speaking of the new recall, Nancy Nord, acting Consumer Product Safety Commission chairwoman, said in a statement, "These recalled toys have accessible lead in the paint and parents should not hesitate in taking them away from children."
2_10	0.11058048	The statement said that the commission had launched an investigation and that "ensuring that Chinese made toys are safe for U.S. consumers is one of my highest priorities and is the subject of vital talks currently in place between CPSC and the Chinese government."
2_11	0.14451338	Earlier this summer, RC2, the maker of Thomas trains, recalled 1.5 million trains and accessories because a Chinese supplier had coated them in lead paint.
2_12	0.11596956	At that time, consumer safety experts and toy industry analysts said that Mattel was unlikely to face such a problem.
2_13	0.12447403	In early July, according to Mattel executives, one of the European retailers that sells Mattel toys discovered the lead on some products.
2_14	0.11739047	On July 6, Mattel stopped operations at the factory that produced the toys and initiated an investigation.
2_15	0.099323252	On July 18, Mattel took a reporter for The New York Times on a tour of a factory in Guanyao, China, and of Mattel's toy safety laboratory in Shenzhen.
2_16	0.099059732	At that time, Mattel executives say, it was unclear whether Mattel was facing a widespread lead paint problem, or if the European case was an anomaly.
2_17	0.10229632	Last Thursday, the company's executives say they received conclusive data that persuaded them to recall the 86 products.
3_0	0.3741882	The toy maker RC2 Corp. pulled a number of its Thomas &amp; Friends trains and accessory parts off the shelves on Thursday after learning that the red and yellow paint used to decorate more than 1.5 million of the toys contained lead.
3_1	0.085076745	Lead, if ingested by children, can cause long-term neurological problems that affect learning and behavior.
3_2	0.23125776	"Parents should not delay in getting these toys away from their kids," Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said Thursday.
3_3	0.19140103	An alert posted at a Web site devoted to the toy line, www.totallythomas.com, included a list of more than two dozen items affected by the recall.
3_4	0.21981288	The company noted that toys that bear a code containing a "WJ" or "AZ" on the bottom of the toy or the inside of the battery door are not included in the recall.
3_5	0.090375436	The company at first urged consumers to mail in their Thomas toys, at their expense, in exchange for a replacement and a free train, an offer that angered some consumers.
3_6	0.073213456	Many Thomas the Tank Engine fans have collected dozens of trains, boxcars or railroad stations, and shipping several heavy pieces could quickly become expensive.
3_7	0.096211003	Later on Thursday, the company, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., agreed to handle the shipping cost for all consumers who request it.
3_8	0.11233179	The affected Thomas toys were manufactured in China, which has come under fire recently for exporting a variety of goods, from pet food to toothpaste, that may pose safety or health hazards.
3_9	0.095144003	"These are not cheap, plastic McDonald's toys," said Marian Goldstein of Maplewood, N.J., who spent more than $1,000 on her son's Thomas collection, for toys that can cost $10 to $70 apiece.
3_10	0.10277932	"But these are what is supposed to be a high-quality children's toy."
3_11	0.098304817	Goldstein's 4-year-old son owns more than 40 pieces from the Thomas series, and seven of them were on the recall list, including the Sodor deluxe fire station, a footlong piece that is a little heavier than the average train.
3_12	0.09795264	Goldstein said she wondered who would pay for testing her son for lead poisoning if her insurance did not cover it.

4_1	0.2749944	Many American parents are facing a quandrary about what toys to buy their children following the recall by Mattel Inc. of almost 1 million Chinese-made toys because they may contain lead.
4_2	0.19298984	As if fears over contaminated toothpaste, poisoned pet food and faulty tires were not enough, the latest recall of Chinese-made products has anxious parents rummaging through toy chests to find tainted Big Birds and Dora the Explorer toys.
4_3	0.12004387	It also has stressed-out toy companies going through their inventory to see if their products are harmless.
4_4	0.21327334	And it has China, again, insisting that its products are safe.
4_5	0.36637055	On Thursday, Mattel's Fisher-Price brand announced it is recalling 83 types of toys -- including the popular Big Bird, Elmo, Dora and Diego characters -- because their paint contains excessive amounts of lead.
4_6	0.5003022	The recall involves 967,000 plastic preschool toys made by a Chinese vendor and sold in the United States between May and August.
4_7	0.073011446	"I'm less inclined to buy anything from China," said Wendy Schneider-Fisher, of New Albany, Ohio, who was heading into a local Toys "R" Us Thursday.
4_8	0.036991268	"And I'm upset our government doesn't do more to stop it."
4_9	0.23067287	Under current U.S. regulations, children's products found to have more than 0.06 percent lead are subject to a recall.
4_10	0.19952224	For parents, replacing the tainted toys with ones they trust are safe could pose a problem: 80 percent of all toys are made in China.
4_11	0.064906057	"It seems like everything's from China but if I could find a similar toy that was American made, I would definitely buy it even if it cost more," said Allen Mayne, of Columbus, Ohio, who was shopping at a local Toys "R" Us for his 9-year-old daughter.
4_12	0.044965705	"I think it would be in everyone's best interests to look for American-made products, stuff you can feel confident about, stuff that's just not the cheapest junk that you can get," he said.
4_13	0.13045076	With discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. waging price wars, the pressure has been on toy companies to cut costs by producing cheaper toys in China.
4_14	0.13764314	With exceptions like Mattel, which estimates that about 50 percent of its production in China is made in company-owned plants, many toy companies turn to contract factories, a cheaper alternative.
4_15	0.3578824	Thursday's toy recall follows the June recall by RC2 Corp. of 1.5 million wooden railroad toys and set parts from its Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway product line because of lead paint.
4_16	0.17123112	Those toys were also made in China.
4_17	0.11058961	Industry experts are worried there will be more toy recalls to come, and fear parents will be more skeptical when buying holiday toys, even avoiding Chinese products altogether.
4_18	0.1276377	"Everyone is concerned that this could really undermine the traditional toy business if consumers think that the toys are unsafe," said New York-based toy consultant Chris Byrne.
4_19	0.090562693	Mattel, considered by experts as a role model in how to do business in China, remained in crisis control Thursday.
4_20	0.22099826	The company contends the recall was "fast-tracked," allowing it to quarantine two-thirds of the toys before they even made it to stores.
4_21	0.095451707	Still, executives are trying to find out how this situation happened.
4_22	0.087478491	"There is an extreme sense of urgency," said David Allmark, general manager of Fisher-Price.
4_23	0.12553972	Jim Walter, senior vice president of worldwide quality assurance for Mattel, is heading to China to meet with vendors.
4_24	0.088749177	China also moved to clear up another blot on its reputation.
4_25	0.1000075	"China has always conducted international trade in the spirit of being responsible to its trade partners and itself," China's Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said in a statement published Thursday on the ministry's Web site.
4_26	0.094920696	"Ninety-nine percent of China's exports are good and safe."
4_27	0.11687768	There is also increasing pressure for government regulation of the U.S. toy industry.
4_28	0.10564812	Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin introduced a bill last month that he contended would dramatically expand the Consumer Product Safety Commission's ability to protect the public.
4_29	0.096212079	Another piece of legislation, introduced by Durbin and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson would require third-party testing of imported and domestic toys and goods designed for children 5 years old or younger.
4_30	0.10089349	The CPSC now allows manufacturers to inspect and approve their own children's products.
4_31	0.1261193	"We need better regulation of the toy industry.
4_32	0.0995597	Until then, parents are going to have to be the watchdogs," said Joanne Oppenheim, president of Oppenheim Toy Portfolio, which produces an annual independent toy guide.
4_33	0.098525403	Hasbro Inc. said in a statement, it "maintains stringent quality control standards in all aspects of the manufacturing process, in both Hasbro-owned factories as well as factories that are contracted to produce Hasbro-branded product."
4_34	0.097540679	Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit group that produces the "Sesame Street" TV program said Thursday it plans independent audits and other steps in an attempt to hold licensees to the highest health and safety standards.
4_35	0.098911624	Retailers including KB Toys Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Toys "R" Us Inc. said they removed all the affected products off the shelves in recent days, but they are left to contend with shoppers' concerns.

5_1	0.16452741	Mattel apologized Thursday to customers affected by a recall nearly a million toys from its Fisher-Price division and said the move will cut pretax operating income at the world's largest toymaker by $30 million (euro22 million).
5_2	0.37070788	The plastic preschool toys were made in China with paint found to have excessive amounts of lead.
5_3	0.1518221	"We apologize to everyone affected by this recall, especially those who bought the toys in question," Robert A. Eckert, Mattel Inc.'s chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

6_2	0.088140713	Not long ago, Brahams wouldn't have thought the paint on a modern, name-brand toy would be a threat.
6_3	0.200163	But with this week's recall of nearly a million playthings from Mattel Inc.'s Fisher- Price unit because of possible lead paint contamination, a trip to the toy store is leading Brahams and other consumers to think twice before making a purchase.

6_6	0.17708642	There have been a spate of recalls of Chinese-made products, from tires to pet food, but the Mattel recall stands out in part because it involves a long-trusted brand name and because Mattel is known for setting strict production standards.
6_7	0.045962127	The episode shows how even the most diligent companies can run into problems as they farm out production, said Dara O'Rourke, an assistant professor of labor and environmental policy at the University of California, Berkeley.

6_18	0.11490727	Lead paint, which has been banned in the U.S. for 30 years, is considered particularly dangerous for children, whose brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the effects of lead.
6_19	0.06931261	The consequences can include learning disabilities, decreased intelligence, decreased muscle and bone growth, and nervous system and kidney damage.
6_20	0.074155826	Adults also are at risk from lead, and are commonly exposed by breathing in lead dust as a result of remodeling of older homes.
6_21	0.10600815	But lead in toys is especially pernicious because young children tend to put their toys in their mouths.
6_22	0.094295933	Dr. Robert Adler, vice chairman of pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, said children who have simply played with toys made with lead paint are probably at little risk of suffering health problems.
6_23	0.10404629	``The actual amount of lead they get from a limited exposure to the toy, while not desirable, is probably not dangerous," he said.
6_24	0.092702174	But if parents are worried that their child has been exposed to lead, Adler said they can contact their physician and request a lead test.
6_25	0.095934431	Results should be available within a week.
6_26	0.1703583	Mattel, which also makes Barbie dolls and Matchbox cars, said it was able to stop two-thirds of the 967,000 toys recalled in the United States before they hit store shelves.

7_7	0.19817243	Fisher-Price and the commission issued statements saying parents should keep suspect toys away from children and contact the company.
7_8	0.1534427	The commission works with companies to issue recalls when it finds consumer goods that can be harmful.
7_9	0.18334812	Under current regulations, children's products found to have more than.06 percent lead accessible to users are subject to a recall.
7_10	0.28280934	Allmark says the recall was "fast-tracked," which allowed the company to quarantine two-thirds of the toys before they even made it to store shelves.
7_11	0.11301131	In negotiating details of the recall, Fisher-Price and the government agreed to withhold details from the public until Thursday to give stores time to get suspect toys off shelves and Fisher-Price time to get its recall hot line up and running.
7_12	0.16756888	Allmark said the recall was troubling because Fisher-Price has had a long-standing relationship with the Chinese vendor, which had applied decorative paint to the toys.
7_13	0.11241883	Allmark said the company would use this recall as an opportunity to put even better systems in place to monitor vendors whose conduct does not meet Mattel's standards.
7_14	0.07530138	He added: "We are still concluding the investigation, how it happened.
7_15	0.085925527	But there will be a dramatic investigation on how this happened.
7_16	0.089951052	We will learn from this."
7_17	0.21543713	The recall follows another high-profile move from toy maker RC2 Corp., which in June voluntarily recalled 1.5 million wooden railroad toys and set parts from its Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway product line.
7_18	0.14513313	The company said that the surface paint on certain toys and parts made in China between January 2005 and April 2006 contain lead, affecting 26 components and 23 retailers.
7_19	0.12977936	"Anytime a company brings a banned hazardous product into the U.S. marketplace, especially one intended for children, it is unacceptable," said Nancy Nord, acting chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
7_20	0.11351815	"Ensuring that Chinese-made toys are safe for U.S. consumers is one of my highest priorities and is the subject of vital talks currently in place between CPSC and the Chinese government."
7_21	0.12974687	Carter Keithley, president of the Toy Industries Association, praised Mattel's quick response to the problem, and suggested Mattel will use this setback as a lesson for not only the company but for the entire industry.
7_22	0.11739542	However, he expressed concern about how the recall and other toy recalls will play out in consumers' minds in advance of the holiday season.
7_23	0.10806125	"We are worried about the public feeling," said Keithley, adding he observed how toy companies are embracing strict controls during a recent toy safety seminar in China.
7_24	0.099177089	"We have thought all along that (consumers) can be confident in the products," he said.
7_25	0.096497985	"But if companies like Mattel have this, then you have to ask how did this happen?"
7_26	0.10620898	Owners of a recalled toy can exchange it for a voucher for another product of the same value.

8_1	0.344421	Mattel's announcement that it was recalling 1.5 million toys could force a reexamination of how the $22 billion toy industry is overseen by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which largely relies on companies to report problems themselves, consumer groups, analysts and lawmakers said Thursday.
8_2	0.31324385	Like the 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and accessories recalled by RC2 Corp. in June, the Chinese-manufactured toys contained too much lead, Mattel said.
8_3	0.13635776	The recall was announced as safety problems with other Chinese products, such as seafood and tires, have put in doubt the U.S. government's ability to oversee imports.
8_4	0.20761151	``The Consumer Product Safety Commission does not have the resources to catch this type of problem," Mark Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said in an interview.
8_5	0.075968773	``We're seeing this over and over.
8_6	0.093144585	This is an agency that is withering on the vine."
8_7	0.12816833	Four senators, including Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sent a letter Thursday to the commission's acting chairman, Nancy Nord, requesting an assessment within seven days of whether the United States should detain and inspect all children's products from China that contain paint.
8_8	0.54046657	About 80 percent of the toys bought in the United States and about 65 percent of Mattel's toys are made in China, according to the Toy Industry Association and the company.
8_9	0.1658301	``Toys were one of the first consumer products to go to China in a big, big way," said Eric Johnson, a management professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, who has studied the toy industry's migration to China.
8_10	0.31232621	About 60 percent of all product recalls this year have been for goods manufactured in China, according to the safety commission.
8_11	0.095232034	Lead has been a particular problem.
8_12	0.11767601	The agency has issued 18 recall notices for 6.7 million pieces of jewelry for children this year because of dangerous levels of lead, and nearly all of them were from China.
8_13	0.14349418	There were 10 lead-related recalls in 2006, according to the agency.
8_14	0.16103788	Mattel said that it learned of the problem with its toys -- products marketed by the company's Fisher-Price division, including toys shaped like Big Bird, Elmo and Dora the Explorer -- from a European retailer and confirmed it with its own tests.
8_15	0.11275753	The Chinese manufacturer, which the company refuses to identify, has worked for Mattel for 15 years and ``to the best of my knowledge" had not had problems in the past, said David Almark, general manager and senior vice president of marketing of Fisher- Price.
8_16	0.099851824	Mattel is investigating the incident and stopped using the Chinese plant in early July.
8_17	0.17148827	Of the 1.5 million products affected, 967,000 were distributed in the United States, including about 300,000 that made it onto retail shelves, Almark said.
8_18	0.13702825	The recall was particularly surprising to some analysts because Mattel is known for having strict safety standards.
8_19	0.082231132	``It is just unfortunate -- having those standards, yet one was breached," Almark said.
8_20	0.087960576	``It shows that those (rules) were not infallible and we have to do even more."
8_21	0.13142915	The toy industry is generally considered diligent and cautious, industry analysts said.
8_22	0.12164079	Companies are required to report any potential problems to the safety commission, which sets industry standards and does some sample testing.
8_23	0.10047062	``I really think the CPSC is extremely strict as is," said Jim Silver, a toy industry analyst and editor of Toy Wishes magazine.
8_24	0.0990427	``The significance of that is that we're seeing a breakdown of that system.
8_25	0.09796018	It raises a question of whether the industry can continue to be self policing," said Christopher Byrne, an independent toy analyst known as the Toy Guy.
8_26	0.10005693	``If something like this can happen to Mattel, which has some of the most stringent standards, what does that mean for the industry?"
8_27	0.10603352	The safety commission has begun an investigation into the Mattel recall and how such problems can be prevented, Nord said in a written statement.
8_28	0.096653804	Officials at Mattel ``lived up to their reporting obligation," agency spokeswoman Julie Vallese said.
8_29	0.097835441	But the incident could amplify scrutiny of the agency, which has 85 to 100 field investigators.
8_30	0.096854444	The three-person commission has been without a permanent chairman and a quorum since last year, which means that it cannot sue manufacturers, set civil penalties or write new rules.
8_31	0.097179541	The agency has proposed legislation to give it more legal authority, to make it illegal to sell recalled products, and to raise the maximum civil penalty for violations from $1.8 million to $10 million.
8_32	0.098982658	``The agency is running at full speed, and is also running more efficiently than it has run in the past, but would welcome additional resources that Congress may choose to provide," Vallese said.
9_0	0.4101541	News that about 1.5 million wooden Thomas &amp; Friends children's toys were being recalled because they were made with lead paint raised some parents' anxiety levels.
9_1	0.23695823	A week after the recall began, however, there have been no reports of children becoming ill from the toys.
9_2	0.39641978	RC2 Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill., said the recalled toys, based on the popular children's television show that began airing in the United States in 1989, were made in China between January 2005 and April 2007.
9_3	0.13574055	The lead paint used to decorate them could cause brain damage if ingested.
9_4	0.26278967	But RC2 is the only one of 30 manufacturers licensed to make Thomas &amp; Friends Toys that has initiated a recall.
9_5	0.10898901	One of the other makers, Schylling Associated Inc. of Rowley, sells more than two dozen Thomas items.
9_6	0.20172503	The company said it does not use the same factories as RC2 and its toys do not have lead paint.
9_7	0.038049912	Schylling has received some calls from concerned customers during the past week, said spokesman Stephen Medina, but sales have not suffered.
9_8	0.076614736	"We're business as usual," he said.
9_9	0.061882629	Schylling, which was founded in 1975 and has about 60 employees, is known for selling classic toys like rubber ducks and tea sets.
9_10	0.10436013	The company's Thomas items, from whistles to tin drums, only account for about 10 percent of its business.
9_11	0.11478077	RC2 said Friday that it could not provide a list of toy retailers in Massachusetts that sell its products.
9_12	0.14527919	Rick Henry, owner of Cambridge-based Stellabella Toys, said that that he did stock some of the recalled items, but that Thomas toys are not a major part of his business.
9_13	0.19112009	The toys were immediately pulled off the shelf, Henry said, and the recall information was prominently posted.
9_14	0.060855117	So far, he hasn't been deluged with calls from concerned customers.
9_15	0.087687977	"There's been certainly a lot of press," he said.
9_16	0.070362573	"I've been ready for it, but it really hasn't happened."
9_17	0.11877874	But business has been anything but usual for Totally Thomas Toy Depot, which specializes in Thomas &amp; Friends toys.
9_18	0.11098114	The San Diego store, which carries more than 2,000 different kinds of Thomas toys, has been overwhelmed by inquiries about the toys.
9_19	0.091224555	"We were jammed with calls," said Cynthia Wyatt, president of Totally Thomas Inc., which owns Totally Thomas Toy Depot.
9_20	0.13519276	"Every call was about the recall.
9_21	0.089992765	Our 800 line was filled and it spilled into our local line.
9_22	0.092575964	Even our people who were running our store were jammed with calls.
9_23	0.093398621	They didn't even care that there was an 800 number they could call."
9_24	0.096186873	Totally Thomas, like some other retailers, has posted a message on its website,totallythomas.com, to alert customers and direct them to RC2 to find out how to send in the potentially harmful toys to be exchanged.
9_25	0.10589001	"We're really concerned about getting the message to parents so they can get the toys out of the kids' hands," Wyatt said, noting that Totally Thomas employees have been trained to spot the dangerous toys and assist customers in the recall process.
9_26	0.10294771	"I'd be willing to sacrifice sales for that," she said.
9_27	0.13340182	According to RC2, the recalled toys account for only 4 percent of its wooden railway units sold in the United States, although it declined to say how many Thomas &amp; Friends toys it produces annually.
9_28	0.10542635	HIT Entertainment Ltd., which holds licensing rights to Thomas &amp; Friends, said that last year about 50 million toys were manufactured.
9_29	0.097388365	RC2 will reimburse customers for postage and also give them an additional toy for free, and has added more people to its customer service line.
9_30	0.11008657	Wyatt said the company has been acting responsibly since it found out about the lead paint.
9_31	0.098543715	"Recalls in the toy industry are not uncommon, and when it happens we usually only get some poster to post with a letter saying to pull the items off the shelves and that's pretty much all," she said in an e-mail.
9_32	0.097720473	"I think that RC2 is doing their sincere best under the difficult circumstances."
