4_0	0.07692307692307693	MIAMI _ A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive pounded toward Florida Monday, forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes and leaving countless residents to hope that the massive storm would somehow miss their cities.
4_1	0.0	``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
4_2	0.16	From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populated Florida coast as the storm, with winds of more than 155 mph, crept westward across the Atlantic and forecasters' radar screens.
4_3	0.0	``It looks like a giant bullseye out there,'' said Brad Cramer, a lifeguard on Palm Beach.
4_4	0.1111111111111111	All day Monday, state meteorologists offered hope that Hurricane Floyd would be nudged from its westerly course by a trough of low pressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead of making landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, its dangerous eye offshore.
4_5	0.0	But that hope seemed to weaken by early Monday evening as Floyd plowed west and slightly northwest, in the general direction of Palm Beach.
4_6	0.15384615384615385	``This is the sort of the thing you have nightmares about,'' said Bill Bill O'Brien, director of emergency management in Palm Beach County.
4_7	0.0	In a frightening scenario, the hurricane could turn north just as the most powerful winds surrounding the eye make landfall, sending the most destructive part of the hurricane along the coast, meteorologists said.
4_8	0.16666666666666666	Like Andrew in 1992, which killed 40 people, wrecked 160 homes and caused more than $25 billion in damages, Floyd was a category 4 storm on Monday.
4_9	0.14285714285714285	It was on the verge of being a category 5, the most powerful, as of Monday evening, with the power to turn houses into rubble and splinters if it makes landfall.
4_10	0.0	But Jarrell warned that even if the hurricane's eye stays as much as 30 miles off the coast the storm could still rip roofs off houses and flatten walls.

8_0	0.11764705882352941	Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
8_1	0.1111111111111111	``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management Agency's executive associate director.
8_2	0.0	When Andrew slammed into Florida just south of Miami in August 1992, the tardy and disjointed federal response sparked cries of anger from state and local authorities and prompted then-President Bush to name his transportation secretary to coordinate the federal effect.
8_3	0.0	FEMA officials Monday said the agency has changed dramatically since then.
8_4	0.0	They said they were ready to roll and could have supplies into an affected area within hours after the Floyd's passage.
8_5	0.0	``The federal government is being not just reactive to events and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,'' Suiter said.
8_6	0.0625	``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the other things ready to move out to the area.
8_7	0.0	We're doing it now in anticipation of what the requirements might be,'' Suiter said.
8_8	0.0	``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and what to plan for.''
8_9	0.4375	FEMA emergency response centers have been activated in Atlanta, Ga., and Washington, D.C., and it has representatives at state emergency centers from Florida to North Carolina.
8_10	0.05263157894736842	A hurricane liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.
8_11	0.25	Meanwhile, FEMA has positioned ice, water, plastic sheeting, cots, tents, and emergency food and medial supplies in Atlanta where they can be delivered within hours wherever Floyd hits land, said Bruce Baughman, FEMA director of response.
8_12	0.0	There are more than 30,000 rolls of plastic sheeting -- enough to cover 25,000 roofless houses -- and some 100 tons of ice, he said.
8_13	0.0	The supplies are being kept in Atlanta, rather than closer to where the hurricane might hit, in order to protect them.
8_14	0.0	``Depending on the track (taken by the storm) you don't want to get it too far forward because the supplies themselves may become a victim,'' Baughman said.
8_15	0.1875	In addition to the supplies on hand, FEMA has contracted with suppliers to provide additional support such as debris removal, roofing repairs and bulk water if needed, he said.
8_16	0.0	Meanwhile, the federal government is urging individuals to prepare by making their property as hurricane-proof as possible such as removing lawn furniture and listening to local government warnings.
8_17	0.0	Residents also are urged to check the FEMA website for other tips at www.fema.gov.
8_18	0.0	``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said.

9_0	0.2916666666666667	As Hurricane Floyd neared the strength of a Category 5 storm today and headed west, thousands of coastal residents were ordered to evacuate and NASA began moving workers out of the low-lying Kennedy Space Center.
9_1	0.04	``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County, which ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today.

9_3	0.5	Gov. Jeb Bush, whose family lived in Miami during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, declared a state of emergency.

9_10	0.0	The space is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well as wind could be devastating.
9_11	0.2	In addition, forecasters warned NASA of the possibility of 150 mph wind on Wednesday.

9_18	0.0	A hurricane watch was extended frtm the Miami area into southeastern Georgia.
9_19	0.08333333333333333	Even though the storm was expected to turn before making a landfall in that area, its hurricane-force wind could still rake the coast by the middle of the week.
9_20	0.0	Residents along 35 miles of the Georgia coast also began bracing for Floyd, and National Park Rangers on Cumberland Island, the exclusive resort spot where John F. Kennedy Jr. got married, met today to decide whether to evacuate 89 campers and visitors.
9_21	0.6	Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm.
9_22	0.07142857142857142	A storm of that strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale has top sustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing extreme damage.
9_23	0.10714285714285714	Only two category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States since records have been kept: the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which slammed the Florida Keys and killed 423, and Camille, which killed 256 people along the Gulf Coast and in Virginia in 1969.
9_24	0.1111111111111111	When Hurricane Andrew struck southern Miami-Dade County in 1992, it was a Category 4 storm with 150 mph sustained wind and 200 mph gusts.
9_25	0.0	It killed 26 people, made 160,000 homeless and caused damage estimated at $25 billion.
9_26	0.0	Andrew's hurricane-force wind extended out about 25 or 30 miles.
9_27	0.0	By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
9_28	0.0	``This would send hurricane-force winds over much of Florida, depending on its exact track,'' Kimberlain said.
9_29	0.0	The last time NASA had to go through such drastic precautions was for Hurricane Erin in 1995.
9_30	0.0	That came ashore with sustained wind of 85 mph.

9_33	0.0	Four multimillion-dollar rockets stood on launch pads and can't be moved.
9_34	0.0625	Floyd was moving due west at nearly 14 mph today, but was expected to begin gradually turning by evening, initially taking a west-northwest course.
9_35	0.0	Floyd's path depends on a weather system over the central United States.
9_36	0.0	A ridge of high pressure has been blocking Floyd and forcing it to move almost due west, but a low-pressure system moving east could weaken the high pressure.
9_37	0.08333333333333333	If this high-pressure ridge does weaken, the storm could move north, making it less of a threat to the Miami-Dade area -- but more worrisome elsewhere.
9_38	0.0	Depending on its exact track, it could also threaten the Carolinas or even New England, forecasters said.
9_39	0.15384615384615385	Farther out in the Atlantic, storm Gert reached hurricane strength today, with 75 mph wind at late morning.
