1_0	0.52	Now that both sides have admitted a crush of worldwide media attention helped former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave land a plea deal that avoided prison time for seducing a 14-year-old boy, two questions remain.
1_1	0.5333333333333333	Was the constant media coverage, which eventually convinced the victim's family to go along with the plea deal, part of the defense's strategy all along?
1_2	0.0	And should media outlets have tried harder to avoid becoming the biggest factor in a case they were supposed to only observe?
1_3	0.0	"To try to use (media interest) to make it more difficult for the victims' family to go through this process made sense from a tactical standpoint," said Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore, noting that Lafave attended many hearings in the case, ensuring cameras would capture her every move.
1_4	0.21428571428571427	"(But) I don't think even (Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons) could anticipate all of the twists and turns and intensity of the media coverage."
1_5	0.0	Fitzgibbons declined to comment directly on how the media might have impacted the family.
1_6	0.3125	He did say, however, that the media coverage "was by far the most critical factor of the entire case," highlighting how criminal law tactics must change in a media-drenched world.
1_7	0.0	"In years past, generally, defense lawyers would have little or no comment (on high-profile cases)," Fitzgibbons said.
1_8	0.0	"In the last decade, with the proliferation of 24-hour news, the Internet and the large press departments of the police departments, you cannot effectively represent your client unless you can represent that client in the court of public opinion."
1_9	0.0	And that court reached far and wide, with Lafave stories featured on Web sites in Russia and China, and newspapers in Australia and Canada.
1_10	0.0	Last December, the New York Post published a full-page photo of Lafave modeling a bikini beside a motorcycle; in July 2004, the British tabloid newspaper News of the World published the name and school photo of her victim.
1_11	0.0	A quick look through a database of media stories found at least 168 print stories since 2003 on Lafave and about 515 TV news items.
1_12	0.25	"Every time a story aired the attention on the victim's family escalated," said Sinacore, who nevertheless gave most mainstream media coverage high marks.
1_13	0.3333333333333333	"What the victim's family said, was every time this came up the boy would get harassed at school," he said.
1_14	0.0	"If you had to sit back and just from a societal point of view, (ask) what impact does the media have by putting such focus on this case when a young boy is going to be affected, that's the balancing act."
1_15	0.0	Still, the combination of factors - her beauty, her handsome ex-husband and a past that included a lesbian relationship - made saturation coverage inevitable.
1_16	0.0	"I fully admit I was one of the ones eating from the trough on this one," said WFLZ-93.3 FM radio personality M.J. Kelli, who featured photos of the bikini-clad Lafave on his show's web site.

8_3	0.6153846153846154	The former middle school teacher achieved instant notoriety when she was accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student.
8_4	1.0909090909090908	On Tuesday, a judge sentenced her to three years of house arrest and seven years of probation.
8_5	0.07692307692307693	Now classified as a sex offender, Lafave, 25, avoided prison, but she won't be living on Easy Street.
8_6	0.1111111111111111	"We've gotten over one hurdle with this matter in the criminal justice system, but now the ramification of being a sexual offender will be with Debbie for 10 years or longer," said her attorney, John Fitzgibbons.
8_7	0.0	The biggest complication for Lafave could be a requirement that she place her name on the state's sex offender registry.
8_8	0.0	The database contains the names and addresses of sex offenders and some details of their charges.
8_9	0.0	It is available to the public on the Internet.
8_10	0.0	Many sex offenders manage to remain relatively anonymous.
8_11	0.0	But for a woman whose image has been beamed around the world and plastered on the front pages of newspapers, the registry could prove not just invasive but dangerous.

8_14	0.0	Dr. Fred Berlin, a Johns Hopkins University professor, said reintegrating into society is always difficult for sex offenders.
8_15	0.0	Founder of the university's Sexual Disorders Clinic, Berlin said that Lafave, like most female offenders, is unlikely to repeat her behavior, but her battle with mental illness and the scrutiny of her case will present extra challenges.

8_20	0.0	As a sex offender, Lafave is barred from living within 1,000 feet of a school, a playground or other areas where children gather.
8_21	0.0	In a county with nearly 200 parks, 400 day care centers, 240 public schools and 1,200 churches that may have youth centers, that will make house-hunting tough.

8_23	0.0	Lafave will also be barred from seeking employment in places near children.
8_24	0.06666666666666667	And since many employers require applicants to disclose whether they've been convicted of a felony, Lafave's job search won't be easy.
8_25	0.0	Then there's her celebrity status.

9_10	0.8823529411764706	Under the terms of the deal, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman sentenced her to three years of house arrest and seven years' probation.
9_11	0.3888888888888889	The last-minute move spared Lafave the possibility of as much as 30 years in prison and saved her victim, who was 14 when the sexual encounters occurred, from the crush of a media frenzy.
9_12	0.6666666666666666	As part of the agreement, Lafave will also plead guilty to three sex charges in Marion County, including one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition.
9_13	0.125	Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore said media attention played a big part in the state's decision to head back to the bargaining table.
9_14	0.125	He reached a deal with Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons shortly before the two were due back in court to argue over a gag order Timmerman imposed last week.
9_15	0.0	On Tuesday, the victim was set to answer attorney questions at a formal deposition.
9_16	0.0	But early that morning, Sinacore asked a judge for a meeting in his chambers to discuss a possible resolution.

9_21	0.0	"I want to apologize to the court and to the young man involved and his family for my actions.
9_22	0.0	I accept full responsibility for my actions and I'm very sorry," Lafave said.
9_23	0.0	Now classified as a sex offender, the former teacher can no longer work with or near children and cannot live within 1,000 feet of a school, church or playground.
9_24	0.0	She will have a 10 p.m. curfew.
9_25	0.0	She must undergo psychological therapy for four years and submit to a polygraph test once a year to verify that she is abiding by the rules.

9_30	0.0	Those negotiations foundered in October.
9_31	0.2727272727272727	For months afterward, the victim's family held fast to the idea that Lafave should do time.
9_32	0.0	But in the weeks leading up to the high-profile trial, the fortitude of the family seemed to wane.
9_33	0.0	Although the teenager had agreed to detail the relationship on the witness stand, it was unclear how his testimony about his feelings for Lafave might impact a jury, Sinacore said.
9_34	0.6	"He did not from the get go want to harm Debra Lafave.
9_35	0.0	This was someone that he liked," Sinacore said.

9_45	0.05555555555555555	Lafave's former East Bay High schoolmate and lover, Casie Diana Martinez, told prosecutors that the teenage Lafave had struggled with her sexuality and self-image.

9_47	0.125	Last year, Lafave's attorney said he planned to raise an insanity defense.
9_48	0.0	A psychologist hired by the state concluded Lafave was sane when she had sex with the boy.
9_49	0.0	But several psychiatrists have since evaluated her and several, Fitzgibbons said, determined that trauma she suffered after she was raped at 13 and her subsequent mental illness may have led her to actions.

9_53	0.17647058823529413	As in the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, the Washington state school teacher who had a baby with a 13-year-old student, Lafave's case has generated much scrutiny.
