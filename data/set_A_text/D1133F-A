0_1	0.44282118	Britain's senior police officer said here on Saturday night that the attack at Glasgow airport was linked to events in London where two car bombs were defused on Friday.
0_2	0.080201195	Peter Clarke, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the anti- terrorism branch at the Metropolitan Police, told a press conference that one suspect suffering from severe burns is in critical condition and that suspicious device had been found at the hospital where suspect was being treated.

0_7	0.1572133	He reassured people that it is right to raise security level at airports and crowded places, and safety of the people is the government's first duty.
0_8	0.12229615	"The British people must remain united, resolute and strong," he said after chairing a Cobra meeting with the Home Secretary and the security officers.
0_9	0.19688299	The highest security alert level means imminent attack is expected.

1_3	0.078742062	A car had crashed inside the terminal.

2_1	0.19280951	One day after foiling an alleged double car-bomb plot in London, Britain raised its terrorism threat assessment to its highest level on Saturday after two men slammed a Jeep SUV into the departure doors of Glasgow airport, turning the vehicle into a potentially lethal fireball.
2_2	0.13405108	One of the attackers was set ablaze from head to foot, and as he struggled with police, "was throwing punches and shouting, 'Allah, Allah,"' an eyewitness said.
2_3	0.20602826	Britain's threat level was set at "critical," meaning that a further attack was considered imminent.
2_4	0.088300144	The threat level has not been that high since last year, after authorities discovered an alleged plot to attack trans-Atlantic airliners with liquid explosives in August.
2_5	0.11656538	A British security official, speaking in return for customary anonymity, said the heightened level reflected an assessment that the London and Glasgow attacks were "linked in some ways and, therefore, there are clearly individuals who have the capability and intent to carry out further attacks."
2_6	0.19121101	The links related to the way the foiled car-bomb attacks in London and the airport attack in Glasgow had been conceived and planned using vehicles and gasoline, the official said.
2_7	0.07752994	Within an hour of the announcement, authorities said the airport in Liverpool had also been closed until further notice, apparently reflecting a fresh area of concern as an increasingly jittery nation braced for further possible episodes.
2_8	0.13258049	In the United States, officials were following the events closely, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement from Secretary Michael Chertoff saying there were no plans to raise the national threat level.
2_9	0.080278519	Still, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said additional security measures were being taken at the region's airports, and New York City police were taking steps that included sending officers into parking garages with sensors that detect the presence of chemical, biological or radiological agents.
2_10	0.093481524	Willie Rae, the chief constable of the Strathclyde area around Glasgow, called Saturday's attack an act of terrorism.
2_11	0.10730567	The police said two men were arrested.
2_12	0.098883448	One of the two men in the attack had been injured and had been found to be wearing a "suspicious device" when he was taken to a hospital for treatment.
2_13	0.096552928	The hospital was evacuated, the police officer said, but declined to comment on reporters' suggestions that the assailant -- said to be in a critical condition -- had been wearing a suicide bombers' belt.
2_14	0.12249253	The attacks confronted Britain's new prime minister, Gordon Brown, with his first major crisis.
2_15	0.096797421	He summoned two emergency meetings of the high-level security committee called Cobra to try to come to grips with the newest attacks.
2_16	0.098157387	The episodes in London and Scotland deepened foreboding among security experts that Britain was confronting a new threat: the use of relatively unsophisticated, homemade explosive devices to claim lives and spread mayhem.

4_2	0.14609841	Until Brown spoke, there had been no official confirmation that the incident in Glasgow Saturday afternoon was being treated as a deliberate attack.
4_3	0.08580649	"The first duty of a government is the security and safety of all the British people," Brown said in a televised statement from his Downing Street office.
