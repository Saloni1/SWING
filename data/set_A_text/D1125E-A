6_1	0.29555234	In December, the Bush administration, facing a deadline under a suit by environmental groups, proposed listing polar bears throughout their range as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because the warming climate is causing a summertime retreat of sea ice that the bears use as for seal hunting.

8_21	0.075544092	Just as the tobacco industry always could find a ``scientist" to claim that there was no link between smoking and lung cancer, climate-change deniers such as Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., always will find polar bear population numbers and trends that purport to prove that the species is doing fine.
8_22	0.15198099	More polar bears are being seen near human settlements in Canada, they say, therefore polar bear populations must be increasing.
8_23	0.1014319	Wrong.
8_24	0.097076288	A study by NASA and Canadian Wildlife Service scientists published in September 2006 in the journal Arctic demonstrated that more polar bears were indeed being seen on land -- not because the species was ``overly abundant" but because the bears had nowhere else to go.
8_25	0.12528698	They should be out on the ice hunting seals, but earlier breakup of sea ice means the bears are stuck on land, where they are more likely to be spotted.
8_26	0.10366987	Inhofe and the Wall Street Journal would take no action to protect polar bears until their population has declined significantly.
8_27	0.12977637	But five of the 19 distinct polar bear populations are already known to be declining.
8_28	0.093021478	And given the undisputed trajectory of sea ice retreat, the species must still be considered threatened even if there were not yet any evidence of population decline.
8_29	0.090928138	If a ship starts taking on water, you don't wait until the first passenger drowns before issuing a mayday; the passengers are clearly ``threatened" as soon as the water starts pouring in.
8_30	0.13803635	But polar bears are not the first species (nor will they likely be the last) for which we have sought the protections of the Endangered Species Act because of global warming.
8_31	0.095749216	The first, in 2001, was the Kittlitz's murrelet, a small seabird that feeds at the mouth of tidewater glaciers and whose decline corresponds to the global-warming-induced retreat of those glaciers.
8_32	0.096456579	Alas, the eyes of the world did not turn to the plight of the Kittlitz's murrelet, as we had hoped, and the administration quietly refused to protect it, a decision we are challenging in court.
8_33	0.097626969	In 2004, we filed a petition seeking protection for the staghorn and elkhorn corals, species that have declined by more than 90 percent because of a host of threats, including global warming.
8_34	0.11105662	The corals were listed as threatened species in May, but with far less fanfare than the polar bear and without an explicit recognition of global warming as a cause of their decline.
8_35	0.095868784	In November, we petitioned to protect 12 penguin species, including the ice-dependent emperor penguin.
8_36	0.097224776	These species are, unfortunately, just the tip of the extinction iceberg.
8_37	0.097518054	One study estimates that a third of the Earth's creatures will be condemned to extinction by 2050.
8_38	0.098055772	Polar bears might not be extinct until 2040, but that doesn't mean we have 30 years to do nothing.
8_39	0.098066571	Hansen, the NASA climate scientist, repeatedly has warned that merely keeping up the current pace of emissions for 10 more years will irreversibly alter the Earth's climate.
8_40	0.097867626	If sea levels rise 18 feet or more, a large proportion of the world's human population will be displaced -- or worse.
8_41	0.13421434	Polar bears are not the only species threatened by global warming.

9_1	0.26427861	Environmental activists, hunters and oil industry representatives spoke at a public hearing on whether the U.S. government should list polar bears as a threatened species.
9_2	0.16952387	Some speakers said scientific evidence supports the listing and urged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to adopt protections so polar bears would be present for future generations.
9_3	0.12828994	"We need to ultimately recognize the threat that global warming poses not just to polar bears but countless other species, from Caribbean corals to the California butterflies to us as well," said Melissa Waage of the Center for Biological Diversity at Monday night's hearing.
9_4	0.21488237	But others said listing the polar bear as threatened could hurt the hunting industry, whose revenues help local economies.
9_5	0.075804635	"The scientific underpinnings of the proposal are woefully inadequate," said Richard Krause, senior director of regulatory relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
9_6	0.047202402	"Rather than basing the proposal on direct scientific observations, the Service bases its proposal on speculative predictions and assumptions that may or may not be valid."
9_7	0.165045	The Fish and Wildlife Service's review comes amid concerns that global warming is melting away the icy habitats where the animals live.
9_8	0.63699642	In December, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne proposed listing polar bears as a threatened species.
9_9	0.2084828	If the polar bear were listed as a threatened species, all federal agencies would have to ensure that anything they authorize that might affect polar bears will not jeopardize their survival or the sea ice where they live.
9_10	0.058741187	That could include oil and gas exploration, commercial shipping or even releases of toxic contaminants or climate-affecting pollution.
9_11	0.12808468	Environmentalists hope that invoking the Endangered Species Act protections might eventually lead the government to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases blamed for warming the atmosphere.
9_12	0.082905485	"The Interior Deparment has pretty much explicitly said that they don't think they have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emission, but we know that the Endangered Species Act goes well beyond these walls, that it's taken into account by other agencies," said Kert Davies, research director for Greenpeace.
9_13	0.082250108	Chris Miller, a real estate agent from Woodbridge, Virginia, expressed a personal connection to the animal after she came face to face with a polar bear on a trip to Canada.
9_14	0.093637776	"I feel I have a responsibility," Miller said.
9_15	0.078846662	"He gave me a second chance and I feel I owe it to them to try to give back."
9_16	0.097055865	About 30 people in the crowd showed their support for the animal by sporting orange life perservers and white baseball caps with a polar bear face and ears.
9_17	0.10226293	One of them, 8-year-old Kate Muffett of Washington, said, "I am also affected by polar bears disappearing for I would love to see polar bears."
9_18	0.097909382	But Patterk Netser, an environmental minister for the Nunavut Territory of Canada, said: "They are not endangered.
9_19	0.096905962	They are not threatened at the moment.
9_20	0.092740029	We have an abudance of them in our area."
9_21	0.099003807	A final decision on the listing is due by January 2008.
9_22	0.11922393	The Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments on the proposed listing until April 9.
9_23	0.097905503	It held a public hearing last week in Anchorage, Alaska, and another is scheduled for Wednesday in Barrow, Alaska.
9_24	0.096905802	Greenland and Norway have the most polar bears, while a quarter of them live mainly in Alaska and travel to Canada and Russia.
