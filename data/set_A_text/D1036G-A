7_45	0.0	But it is not known to produce pain.
7_46	0.0	Dermatologists at Rudolfinerhaus initially suggested that the facial lesions could represent a slightly unusual case of a well-known condition called rosacea, where the face becomes swollen and lumpy.
7_47	0.0	But Zimpfer said Yushchenko's skin nodules no longer indicated that disease.

7_50	0.0	Political intrigue is not the norm at Rudolfinerhaus, an elite private hospital that caters to wealthy Austrians and foreigners.
7_51	0.0	Zimpfer provided extensive details of Yushchenko's hospitalizations.
7_52	0.08333333333333333	He arrived first on Sept. 10, severely ill and unable to walk, after five days of terrible abdominal pain.
7_53	0.0	Initial testing showed that he had a high white cell count, as well as elevated liver and pancreas enzymes, suggesting inflammation of those organs.
7_54	0.0	His tests were negative for all the obvious possibilities, like hepatitis caused by a virus.
7_55	0.0	Scans showed that his liver, pancreas and intestine were, indeed, swollen.
7_56	0.0	Internal examinations of the intestine using an endoscope found that he had ulcerations -- essentially bleeding abrasions -- of the stomach and throughout his intestine and bowel as well.
7_57	0.0	Ulcers are typically not spread out in that way.
7_58	0.07692307692307693	The doctors gave him supportive care, like intravenous fluid and a restricted food intake to rest the digestive tract.
7_59	0.0	As he gradually recovered strength, he opted to get back to the campaign trail.
7_60	0.0	Already, doctors noticed that he was developing odd lesions on his face and trunk.
7_61	0.18181818181818182	Ten days later, the candidate returned, after three days of what he called excruciating back pain.
7_62	0.0	Its source was again a mystery, since related lab tests and scans were normal.
7_63	0.058823529411764705	The pain was so severe that doctors had to place a large-bore intravenous line into Yushchenko's chest and essentially nearly anesthetize him with huge doses of opiates.
7_64	0.0	Because opiates depress respiratory functions, his breathing rate slowed, and his vital signs had to be constantly monitored.
7_65	0.0	More medicine would have required that Yushchenko be placed on a respirator, Zimpfer said.
7_66	0.0	Yushchenko and his doctors made a difficult choice: They decided to place an epidural catheter between his shoulder blades into the membranes of the upper spine so that medicines could be delivered to the nerves in his back without compromising his mental abilities.
7_67	0.0	Epidural catheters are common for pain relief in childbirth, but they are far riskier when they are placed for longer periods and in the upper back, closer to the brain and vital nerves.
7_68	0.0	Yushchenko was discharged three days later, leaving with a retinue of doctors and cartons of medical supplies.
7_69	0.0	He was still on "plenty" of medication, said Zimpfer.
7_70	0.0	They arrived in Ukraine, and, after a few hours, Zimpfer returned to Vienna, leaving Yushchenko in the care of another Austrian doctor.
7_71	0.0	"He was severely ill, but this does not all add up to a single disease or even a known syndrome," Zimpfer said.
7_72	0.0	"At this point his diagnosis is just a description of all his symptoms."
8_0	0.23529411764705882	Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in Vienna who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed Saturday.
8_1	0.13043478260869565	Yushchenko, a pro-Western opposition leader engaged in a bitter presidential contest, has alleged since suddenly falling ill in September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt intended to eliminate a key critic of Ukraine's government.
8_2	0.16666666666666666	Authorities have denied the charge, and some government supporters have ridiculed it.
8_3	0.09523809523809523	Michael Zimpfer, director of the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic that has been treating Yushchenko, said tests concluded in the last 24 hours prove that dioxin caused the illness that has disfigured the Ukrainian candidate's face.
8_4	0.13333333333333333	``There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning,'' he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic.
8_5	0.0	The doctors, Zimpfer said, ``suspect the involvement of an external party,'' and that the dioxin was given orally.
8_6	0.5	``The criminal investigation does not fall within our purview,'' he added.
8_7	0.0	The diagnosis was based on clinical observations, skin changes and findings from tissue and blood samples, he said.
8_8	0.0	Asked whether he had reported his findings to the Ukrainian authorities, Zimpfer replied that Austrian justice officials have been in direct contact with Ukraine since Yushchenko's second hospitalization in late September.
8_9	0.14285714285714285	Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, the day after having late-night food and drinks with the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, among other people.

8_12	0.0	``And I asked him about it.
8_13	0.0	He brushed it away, saying there is nothing.''
8_14	0.18181818181818182	Yushchenko has suffered problems that affected several internal organs and caused severe back pain, according to his doctors.
8_15	0.0	The most visible symptom has been disfigurement of his face with pockmarks, cysts and darkened areas.
8_16	0.15384615384615385	In recent weeks, medical experts in various countries have said the facial condition appeared to be chloracne, which is associated with dioxin poisoning.
8_17	0.30434782608695654	The explosive allegation of attempted murder, now backed by fresh medical evidence, could have an unpredictable effect on a repeat presidential runoff election pitting Yushchenko against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on Dec. 26.
8_18	0.0	The revote was set after the Supreme Court ruled the Nov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych, invalid because of fraud.
8_19	0.16666666666666666	Yushchenko supporters, however, already believed he had been poisoned, and it was not immediately clear how many Yanukovych backers would be willing to believe the Vienna doctors.
8_20	0.0	Some people in the opposition camp remained nervous whether the Dec. 26 balloting really would take place.
8_21	0.0625	Saturday's announcement potentially raised the stakes by increasing the possibility that if the poisoning were an assassination attempt, those responsible might be caught and punished under a Yushchenko presidency.
8_22	0.05263157894736842	``I don't want all of us to have the impression that the Yanukovych campaign and Yanukovych himself have relaxed and stopped fighting,'' Yulia Tymoshenko, a key opposition leader, said at a Saturday news conference in Kiev, the capital.
8_23	0.0	``They will try everything for the presidential elections not to happen, or not to have a result.''
8_24	0.0	Under Ukrainian law, if a presidential election is so flawed that it is impossible to determine the result, it is possible for the incumbent to remain in power while new balloting is organized.
8_25	0.0	Speaking to a rally in the eastern city of Luhansk before the Vienna announcement, Yanukovych expressed sympathy for Yushchenko.
8_26	0.0	``He really is a sick person,'' Yanukovych replied.

8_32	0.15384615384615385	Yanukovych's campaign manager, Taras Chornovyl, has rejected any possibility that the prime minister was involved in the alleged poisoning.
8_33	0.0	There is ``no logic in such an accusation,'' he said.
8_34	0.09090909090909091	Yushchenko first checked into the Vienna clinic Sept. 10, at which point, according to Zimpfer, he had been ill for five days.
8_35	0.2	The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said.
8_36	0.0	Yushchenko's dioxin levels in blood and tissue samples taken in September but only recently tested specifically for that substance were at least 1,000 times higher than normal, a level Zimpfer said required a dose of just milligrams.
8_37	0.0	``It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup, for example,'' he said.
8_38	0.0	Zimpfer said that Yushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to normal and that he probably would leave the clinic Sunday or Monday.
8_39	0.1	Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
8_40	0.0	``It is possible that we only found the dioxin,'' he said.
8_41	0.0	Damage to the digestive system suggested that the poison had been ingested orally, he said.
