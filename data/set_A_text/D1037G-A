0_0	0.3888888888888889	A decision about whether to introduce a new species of Chinese oyster into the Chesapeake Bay has been put off a few months longer because of delays in a scientific study, Maryland officials say.
0_1	0.16666666666666666	The study, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is intended to guide the governors of Virginia and Maryland as they decide whether to allow the oyster Crassostrea ariakensis@ to reproduce in the Chesapeake.
0_2	0.0	First expected this month at the latest, the report is now due in June or July because of a delay in creating a computer model of how the oysters might spread and reproduce, officials said.

0_7	0.0	The oyster debate is part of a larger, multibillion-dollar struggle to return the bay to its 1950s condition by 2010.
0_8	0.0	Environmentalists say the effort has been consumed by bureaucracy that has allowed the bay to decay further.
0_9	0.38461538461538464	Among the bay's problems, one of the worst has been the decline of the native oyster Crassostrea virginica,@ once so populous that its reefs poked out of the water.
0_10	0.0	Even after European colonization, its harvests were bountiful enough that the Eastern Shore town of Crisfield, Md., was built on a foundation of discarded oyster shells.
0_11	0.18181818181818182	But over the past three decades, the bay's oysters have been ravaged by pollution and a pair of diseases.
0_12	0.125	The pollution, from farms and sewage plants across the bay's 64,000-square-mile watershed, causes algae blooms that suck oxygen from the water.
0_13	0.0	Oysters, unlike fish and crabs, can't swim away from ``bad water'' areas, so they are weakened or killed.
0_14	0.21428571428571427	The diseases, one of them introduced when another strain of Asian oyster was placed in the bay decades ago, kill oysters before they grow large.
0_15	0.3125	Combined, these factors have caused a stunning decline in Maryland oyster harvests: from about 2,600,000 bushels in 1974-75 to about 26,000 bushels last year.
0_16	0.16666666666666666	In desperation, the two bay states have turned to the Chinese oyster, which has been grown for about 30 years in Oregon and is believed to be immune to the Chesapeake's oyster diseases.
0_17	0.17647058823529413	The hope is that the new species could take the native oyster's former role in the bay: as a moneymaker for watermen and a natural filter for polluted water.
0_18	0.5	As optimism about the new oyster has grown in the administration of Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich, a Republican, pessimism has spread among scientists.

1_4	0.0	Maryland officials responded Wednesday that they would not make any moves before they were sure the new oyster is safe.
1_5	0.0	``We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions about,'' said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.
1_6	0.0	The two states' criticism marks a new turn in the saga of Crassostrea Ariakensis, a native of China that has recently caused unusual divisions within the staid world of shellfish management.
1_7	0.3333333333333333	It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
1_8	0.42857142857142855	Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.
1_9	0.0	``We're so low that the next stop is zero,'' said Pete Jensen, an official with the Department of Natural Resources.
1_10	0.6	The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake.
1_11	0.0	But scientists believe there are many potential downsides -- even beyond the dinner-table prospects of an oyster that can resemble an orange portobello mushroom cap.
1_12	0.0	Scientists point to the havoc caused in the bay ecosystem by other nonnative species: The mute swan and beaverlike nutria chew up crucial grasses, and the toothy northern snakehead has worried fishermen in the Potomac River.
1_13	0.42857142857142855	They worry that the Asian oysters could bring new diseases or adapt to the Chesapeake so well that they squeeze out native species of oysters and clams.
1_14	0.0	To answer such questions fully might take many years of research, according to reports by the National Academy of Sciences and a trio of federal agencies: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
1_15	0.25	Julie Thompson, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service, said Wednesday that the federal agencies were concerned that the Asian oyster would be impossible to remove once released in the wild.

1_17	0.0	Franks said Wednesday that all the necessary research has been compressed into a year.
1_18	0.0	That study, performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, could be finished in the next couple of weeks, he said.
1_19	0.0	After that, Franks said, the data will be reviewed by a panel of experts appointed by Ehrlich and Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D).

2_0	0.2222222222222222	Teeming with raw sewage, animal waste and fertilizer runoff, yet responsible for half the Chesapeake Bay's fresh water, the Susquehanna River is the most endangered river in the United States, according to a report released this week by American Rivers, a national conservation group.
2_1	0.06896551724137931	Pennsylvania's massive Susquehanna, the bay's biggest tributary, tops a list of 10 American rivers with uncertain futures, including Ohio's Little Miami River, Tennessee's Roan Creek and South Carolina's Santee River.
2_2	0.0	Most of them, said American Rivers President Rebecca R. Wodder, are befouled by raw sewage and urban and farm runoff -- problems made worse by population growth and cuts to federal cleanup money.
2_3	0.0	The Susquehanna exemplifies ``the crisis we're highlighting in this report, that when it rains in America, raw sewage pours into our rivers and streams -- in an increasing amount,'' she said.
2_4	0.0	Uphill and upstream from the bay, thousands of acres of Pennsylvania crop- and pastureland abut the banks of the Susquehanna or the creeks and streams that feed it.
2_5	0.0	The farms are so small and far-flung that state environmental agencies struggle to bring all of them into compliance with laws governing pollutant runoff.
2_6	0.0	The report also cites runoff from urban centers and the hundreds of sewer pipes that overflow in rainy weather, spewing human waste and garbage into the river.
2_7	0.2	Fertilizer nutrients and filth from the Susquehanna is a chief cause of the algae blooms and pollution that suck oxygen from the Chesapeake Bay, decimating crab, oyster, fish and aquatic plant populations.
2_8	0.0	A University of Maryland consultant has estimated that the river contributes 40 percent of the nitrogen and 20 percent of the phosphorus -- two key ingredients in fertilizers -- to the bay.
2_9	0.2222222222222222	``Pennsylvania is committed to reducing the nutrients and sediments that flow into our local streams and, in doing that, restoring the Chesapeake Bay,'' said Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Charlie Young.
2_10	0.0	``But the federal government is talking about reducing the amount of (water cleanup money) that goes to Pennsylvania by almost $25 million'' next year, he said.
2_11	0.0	Among state-funded cleanup efforts has been a $250 million bond issue last year to pay for sewage treatment plant upgrades, Young said.
2_12	0.0	This year, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, D, is backing a proposal in the state legislature to issue another $800 million in bonds for water and sewage system improvements, to be voted on in coming days.
2_13	0.0	Wodder said federal cuts to Pennsylvania's cleanup budget reflect the situation nationally.
2_14	0.0	For example, she said, the Bush administration's proposed 2006 budget calls for cutting spending on the federal clean-water fund to $730 million, from $1.1 billion last year.
2_15	0.0	``The feds are not contributing their fair share to solving the problem,'' she said.
2_16	0.0	Benjamin Grumbles, assistant administrator for water at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the pared-back funding of $730 million in the president's budget request ``is part of a multi-year effort to commit $6.8 billion through 2011'' to the fund, which he said is intended to provide seed money to state-based loan programs to improve sewage treatment infrastructure.
2_17	0.0	Overall, Grumbles said, the EPA favors more state-based water quality initiatives and ``innovative'' programs to combat pollution, such as pollution credits, which can be traded among top-polluting industries.

9_23	0.0	That amounts to 20 cents a crab.
9_24	0.0	Adding to the undesirability in these jobs, experts say, is the fact that in recent years they have changed from year-round to seasonal because there no longer are enough shellfish in the polluted bay to sustain them.
