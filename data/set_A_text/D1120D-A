0_0	0.11107913	For most of its 15-year life, the desalination plant on this city's western edge has produced more rhetoric than desalted water, its squat campus less an idle factory than a convenient symbol in the scuffle over scarce resources.
0_1	0.30350063	For Arizona water managers, the $280 million desalter represented a way to stretch the Colorado River a little further, hedging against drought and growing demand.
0_2	0.12408464	Up and running, the desalter could convert billions of gallons of agriculture wastewater each year into a usable resource, preserving long-term storage in Lake Mead and protecting Arizona from shortages.
0_3	0.084177758	For environmental groups, the plant embodied a destructive "use- it-up" attitude about water and a direct threat to a thriving wetland 90 miles south in Sonora.
0_4	0.06974881	The agriculture wastewater intended for desalination feeds the wetland, providing habitat for birds and fish, and supports a small local economy.
0_5	0.093671334	Without the water, the wetland would dry up.
0_6	0.14754289	Not quite three years ago, on a beach in the bottom of the Grand Canyon, a water manager and an environmentalist struck up a conversation.
0_7	0.071798057	Before long, they were working on a plan that would ultimately recast the desalter as a symbol of two disparate interests finding common ground.
0_8	0.071895143	The plan faces its first test in early March, when the federal government restarts the plant for a 90-day, low-power test run.
0_9	0.054297632	Officially, the test will help determine whether the desalter still works, how much operating it full time would cost and how it would affect the wetland known as the Cienega de Santa Clara, a critical habitat for migratory birds.
0_10	0.065779967	But the test will provide more than just technical data.
0_11	0.13861918	It also will bring together the West's water buffaloes - the use-it-up gang - and the increasingly influential conservation movement for a grand experiment in the management and the politics of water.
0_12	0.13857986	"The Colorado River is absolutely a finite resource, and we have to be careful in how we manage it," said Jennifer Pitt, a senior resource analyst for the advocacy group Environmental Defense who was part of that first campfire conversation.
0_13	0.075358451	"But the truth is there's a lot of water there.
0_14	0.21870633	We've seen time and time again that the law of the river can be flexible enough to meet the needs of water users in the basin.
0_15	0.074613535	There can be benefits for everybody."
0_16	0.076507356	The history
0_17	0.077905461	Standing on the main floor of the Yuma Desalination Plant, surrounded by long rows of fiberglass membranes stacked more than 7 feet high, Jim Cherry can't help but smile.
0_18	0.16275015	"These are exciting times here," said Cherry, Yuma area manager for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the desalter.
0_19	0.054267197	"Crews are busy checking pipes, checking pumps, checking for leaks.
0_20	0.059701563	People have been working here 15 years or more, and we've never really operated the plant."
0_21	0.17104015	The desalter's original purpose was to help the United States meet the terms of a water-quality treaty with Mexico, which protested the increasing levels of salt and other nutrients in the Colorado River by the time it reached the border.
0_22	0.10503975	The bureau decided to divert water drained from farm fields in the nearby Wellton-Mohawk Valley, remove the salt and send it down the river.
0_23	0.066603893	After floods washed away one of the diversion canals in 1992, the bureau mothballed the plant, just nine months after turning it on.
0_24	0.080765059	A series of wet years rendered it unnecessary.
0_25	0.065987418	Since then, Cherry has presided over a group of caretakers, who kept the plant in working condition, and a group of scientists who developed a water-treatment research center using a one-hundredth scale version of the plant.
0_26	0.08377084	Cherry said the researchers used the time well.
0_27	0.10046827	They increased the plant's efficiency from a 73 percent recovery rate, when 10 gallons of raw water produced slightly more than seven gallons of treated water, to about 85 percent.
0_28	0.086223721	They also tried desalting local groundwater to see if the plant could produce drinking water someday for small communities on either side of the border.
0_29	0.066836935	"The plant was authorized to do one thing," Cherry said, "but we can study whether we could do other things."
0_30	0.15523056	It's the one thing - stretching the over-allocated Colorado River - that stuck in the minds of Arizona water managers.
0_31	0.13986175	When drought struck the river in the early years of this decade, lowering reservoir storage by half, state officials brought up the idea of restarting the desalination plant.
0_32	0.11886354	To meet the Mexican treaty terms without the desalter, the bureau had been drawing water from Lake Mead at the rate of about 100,000 acre-feet a year, more than 32 billion gallons.
0_33	0.12173433	From the day the plant stopped running in 1992, water continued to flow over the border down the delivery channels, which meant, on paper, Mexico was receiving more than its share of river water.
0_34	0.07625045	The solution, Arizona officials argued, was clear: Turn the desalter back on.
0_35	0.089430485	That is when the birds flew into the picture.
0_36	0.090253009	The conflict
0_37	0.10075512	All that water flowing past the desalter into Sonora didn't just vanish into the desert.
0_38	0.083820961	It collected in a geological depression formed by a branch of the San Andreas Fault and revived a wetland that had nearly dried up.
0_39	0.098985522	Inside of a decade, the marshy area grew from a few hundred acres, derisively called the Santa Clara Slough, to the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara, a wetland that harbors some of the rarest species in the hemisphere.
0_40	0.090944042	"It's the most biologically significant wetland in the Sonoran Desert," said Karl Flessa, a University of Arizona geosciences professor.
0_41	0.0835317	"It is a remnant wetland of what was once an enormous complex of wetlands that were either converted to ag land or have simply dried up.
0_42	0.080071172	The idea here is we better hang on to what we've got.
0_43	0.091962363	It's the last stand for wetlands on the Mexican side."
0_44	0.10840137	Conservation groups rallied against restarting the desalter because, as designed, it would take most of the water feeding the wetland and return only the sludge left from the desalination process.
0_45	0.088440619	Environmentalists attacked the desalter as a waste of money, a white elephant that would trample a delicate slice of desert life.
0_46	0.12869699	For many activists the wetland also helped support arguments for restoring water to the larger Colorado River Delta, a 1.9 million acre expanse from the U.S.-Mexican border to the Gulf of California, the river's historic endpoint.
0_47	0.1000793	The river rarely reaches the delta anymore, its flow sucked dry by dams, canals and other diversion points along its final miles.
0_48	0.091093752	The Santa Clara offered on-the-ground proof that a little water could help revive the delta.
0_49	0.099112975	"One of the reasons the delta is so interesting is that simply adding water will get you a quick response," said Michael Cohen, a senior researcher at the Pacific Institute, an environmental research group.
0_50	0.12145079	"In the early 1990s, floods flowed through the river and the cottonwoods and willows came back.
0_51	0.10212864	It happened naturally, not because some manager decided to release water."
0_52	0.098098838	The solution
0_53	0.15122353	Which brings us to the campfire along the Colorado River in the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
0_54	0.11022692	In the spring of 2004, Bennett Raley, then a deputy Interior secretary, took a group of water managers, environmentalists and journalists on a rafting trip on the Colorado, hoping to spark conversations about the river's future.
0_55	0.098423971	Among the rafters were Pitt, the Environmental Defense analyst who wanted the desalter kept silent, and Sid Wilson, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who was leading the charge to restart the plant.
0_56	0.095802105	Pitt had recently signed a letter to Gov. Janet Napolitano, asking her to block the desalter's operation, and everyone on the trip knew it.
0_57	0.11110093	For Wilson, the issue was basic: In the event of a shortage on the Colorado, the CAP canal, which delivers river water to Phoenix and Tucson, takes the first and biggest hit.
0_58	0.15011913	Anything to keep water in Lake Mead could forestall a shortage.
0_59	0.09604609	"When we started talking about it, the U.S. position was that it cost too much," Wilson said.
0_60	0.097439351	"The governor had letters from the environmental organizations opposing it.
0_61	0.096930678	Pitt and Wilson continued talking after the trip, and inside of a few months, they hatched an idea to organize a working study group.
0_62	0.097177387	That group produced a plan to operate the desalter in a way that could still protect the Cienega de Santa Clara.
0_63	0.096871982	"I'd invested a lot of energy in simply trying to tell the world what a problem the plant would be," Pitt said.
0_64	0.096120141	"That didn't put me in a space where it made sense to think about how it could operate without harming the cienega."
0_65	0.096669655	The group proposed a series of ideas, most based on finding other water sources to meet the treaty terms and still support the wetlands.
0_66	0.098444738	The other sources could include groundwater or runoff from other farm fields.
0_67	0.098328783	The group also proposed expanding the mission of the plant so it could offer the desalted water to communities in short supply.
0_68	0.10107895	Both water managers and environmental groups see a broader picture in this debate.
0_69	0.11147624	Arizona considers the plant critical to the success of a seven-state Colorado River drought plan, a document that relies on augmenting the river's flow.
0_70	0.10003782	Conservationists say the Santa Clara's continued health will boost efforts to restore wider swaths of the river delta.
0_71	0.09728713	"A little bit of water goes a long way," UA's Flessa said.
0_72	0.10648097	"The whole Colorado River is a story of using and reusing water.
0_73	0.098169362	This is an example of where at the grass-roots level, these agencies and the other groups got together and said, 'Let's see what we can do.'

2_6	0.2416878	Scientists have concluded that the Colorado river system, which supplies water to 25 million people and several million acres of crop and ranch land, has been drier and more prone to severe drought than was the case in the early 20th century, when the river's flows were divvied among the seven basin states.
2_7	0.11405215	It turns out that period was unusually wet, prompting an overly generous estimate of how much water would be available to farms and cities.
2_8	0.078452032	Ancient tree rings, which provide graphic evidence of past precipitation patterns, indicate it had been three centuries since the basin was last awash with that much water.
2_9	0.33985515	The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.

2_18	0.097781813	The report acknowledges some uncertainty over whether climate change would alter the amount of precipitation in the basin.
2_19	0.093433446	But as the mercury rises, water demands would increase.
2_20	0.09300158	There would be more evaporation from croplands and reservoirs, and wild land vegetation would suck more moisture from the soil, reducing runoff.
2_21	0.10432701	``I think a reasonably savvy person would have to say you're going to see less water in that river," said Brad Udall, director of Western Water Assessment at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who was not a member of the report committee.

2_24	0.11401674	The U.S. Department of Interior, which oversees the Colorado's management, is reviewing a drought plan the states put together last year.
2_25	0.1304106	Because California holds some of the most senior rights to the river, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico would experience cuts in deliveries before California, said Roger Patterson, assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
2_26	0.11609729	The river is a major source for Metropolitan, Southern California's major urban water supplier.
2_27	0.11982092	Last year about 30 percent of the agency's water deliveries came from the Colorado, which provides about 10 percent of California's overall urban and agricultural supplies.
2_28	0.11546097	Most of the state's river allotment -- the biggest in the system -- goes to the Imperial Irrigation District, which distributes water to the croplands of the Imperial Valley, one of the nation's biggest lettuce producers.
2_29	0.10123106	Noting that farms remain the dominant water user in the Colorado basin, the report called agricultural water ``the most important and perhaps final large reservoir of available water for urban use in the arid U.S. West."
2_30	0.097934939	But that supply is also finite, the authors emphasized, and shifting water from farm to city could have negative impacts.

3_2	0.23756945	Some $2.5 billion in water projects are planned or under way in four states, the biggest expansion in the West's quest for water in decades.
3_3	0.19406623	Among them is a proposed 280-mile pipeline that would direct water to Las Vegas from northern Nevada.
3_4	0.17167159	A proposed reservoir just north of the California-Mexico border would correct an inefficient water delivery system that allows excess water to pass to Mexico.
3_5	0.09853821	In Yuma, Ariz., federal officials have even restarted an idled desalination plant, long seen as a white elephant from a bygone era, partly in the hope of purifying salty underground water for neighboring towns.
3_6	0.18549725	The scramble for water is driven by the realities of population growth, political pressure and the hard truth that the Colorado River, a 1,400-mile-long silver thread of snowmelt and a lifeline for more than 20 million people in seven states, is providing much less water than it had.
3_7	0.15737335	According to some long-term projections, the mountain snows that feed the Colorado River will melt faster and evaporate in greater amounts with rising global temperature, providing stress to the waterway even without drought.

3_10	0.19071549	Everywhere in the West, along the Colorado and other rivers, as officials search for water to fill current and future needs, tempers are flaring among competing water users, old rivalries are hardening and some states are waging legal fights.
3_11	0.16374386	In one of the most acrimonious disputes, Montana filed a suit in February at the U.S. Supreme Court accusing Wyoming of taking more than its fair share of water from the Tongue and Powder Rivers, north-flowing tributaries of the Yellowstone River that supply water for farms and wells in both states.
3_12	0.24093	Preparing for worst-case outcomes, the seven states that draw water from the Colorado River -- Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico in the upper basin and California, Arizona and Nevada in the lower basin -- and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river, are considering plans that lay out what to do if the river cannot meet the demand for water -- a prospect that some experts predict will occur in about five years.
3_13	0.16051418	"What you are hearing about global warming, explosive growth -- combine with a real push to set aside extra water for environmental purpose -- means you got a perfect situation for a major tug-of-war contest," said Sid Wilson, the general manager of the Central Arizona Project, which brings Colorado River water to the Phoenix area.
3_14	0.21628064	New scientific evidence suggests that periodic long, severe droughts have become the norm in the Colorado River basin, undermining calculations of how much water the river can be expected to provide for the region's future and intensifying pressures to find new solutions or sources.
3_15	0.16662797	The effects of the drought can be seen at Lake Mead in Nevada, where a drop in the water level left docks hanging from newly formed cliffs, and a marina surrounded by dry land.
3_16	0.10387527	Upriver at Lake Powell, which is at its lowest level since spring 1973, receding waters have exposed miles of mud in the fingered side canyons leading to the Glen Canyon Dam.
3_17	0.10672751	In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has sounded alarm bells by pushing for a ballot measure in 2008 that would allocate $4.5 billion in bonds for new water storage in the state.
3_18	0.13797499	The water content in the Sierra Nevada snowpack has reached the lowest level in about two decades, state hydrologists have reported, putting additional pressure on the nation's most populous state to find and store more water.
3_19	0.12549352	"Scientists say that global warming will eliminate 25 percent of our snowpack by the half of this century," Schwarzenegger said recently in Fresno, Calif., "which will mean less snow stored in the mountains, which will mean more flooding in the winter and less drinking water in the summer."

3_22	0.094224767	In Montana, where about two-thirds of the Missouri River and half of the Columbia River have their headwaters, officials have embarked on a long-term project to validate old water-rights claims in an effort to legally shore up supplies the state now counts on.

3_24	0.078751604	The oldest, first-filed claims, many dating to pioneer days, get water first, with newer claims at the bottom of the pecking order.
3_25	0.081236628	Still, some of the sharpest tensions stem more from population growth than cautionary climate science, especially those between Nevada and Utah, states with booming desert economies and clout to fight for what they say is theirs.
3_26	0.15028964	Las Vegas, the fastest growing major city in the country, and the driest, developed the pipeline plan several years ago to bring groundwater from the rural, northern reaches of the state.
3_27	0.21311302	The metropolitan area, which relies on the Colorado River for 90 percent of its water, is awaiting approval from Nevada's chief engineer.
3_28	0.10055305	Ranchers and farmers in northern Nevada and Utah are opposed to the pipeline plan and have vowed to fight it in court, saying it smacks of the famous water grab by Los Angeles nearly a century ago that caused severe environmental damage in the Owens Valley in California.
3_29	0.075053059	"Southern Nevada thinks it can come up here and suck all these springs dry without any problems," said Dean Baker, whose family's ranch straddles the Nevada-Utah border, pointing out springs that farmers have run dry with their own wells.
3_30	0.086010441	"We did this ourselves.
3_31	0.092222352	Now imagine what pumping for a whole big city is going to do."
3_32	0.10953462	Meanwhile, Utah has proposed a $500 million, 120-mile pipeline from Lake Powell to serve the fast-growing City of St. George and Washington County in the state's southwestern corner.
3_33	0.10024107	Nevada officials have said they will seek to block that plan if Utah stands in the way of theirs.
3_34	0.11827331	"Utah is being very disingenuous and we're calling them on it," said Patricia Mulroy, the chief executive of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the water agency responsible for finding water for Las Vegas and its suburbs.
3_35	0.089185777	"St. George, Utah, is growing as fast as southern Nevada, because the growth is going right up the I-15 corridor."
3_36	0.11998288	Dennis J. Strong, director of Utah's Division of Water Resources, said Nevada was protesting too much and instead should be cheering the Lake Powell project because Colorado River water that Utah does not use would flow in Nevada's direction.
3_37	0.090145986	Strong said that Nevada's protests "may be a bargaining chip."
3_38	0.090135449	He said he hoped for a compromise that would allow both projects to move forward.
3_39	0.10323173	In Yuma, on the Arizona border with Mexico, officials have pinned hopes on a desalination plant built 15 years ago.
3_40	0.11590122	The plan then had been to treat salty runoff from farms before it made its way into the Colorado River headed to Mexico, thus meeting the terms of an old water treaty.
3_41	0.10733767	But a series of unusually wet years made it more efficient to meet the treaty obligations with water from Lake Mead, so the plant sat idle.
3_42	0.11844387	Drought has changed all that.
3_43	0.11387999	Arizona water managers, who are first in line to have their water cut in a shortage under an agreement with other states, called for the plant to be turned on.
3_44	0.098420634	Under an agreement with environmentalists, the federal Bureau of Reclamation plans to closely monitor the environmental effects of using the plant, and study, among other things, using the purified water for purposes other than meeting its treaty obligations, like supplying the growing cities around Yuma.
3_45	0.10148829	"It never made sense to me to just dump bottled-water quality water into the river anyway," said Jim Cherry, the bureau's Yuma area manager.
3_46	0.10696742	What unites the Western states is a growing consensus among scientists that future climate change and warmer temperatures, if they continue, could hit harder here than elsewhere in the continental United States.
3_47	0.10054335	"The Western mountain states are by far more vulnerable to the kinds of change we've been talking about compared to the rest of the country, with the New England states coming in a relatively distant second," said Dr. Michael Dettinger, a research hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey who studies the relationships between water and climate.
3_48	0.097171891	Dettinger said warmer temperatures have pushed the spring snowmelt and runoff to about 10 days earlier on average than in the past.
3_49	0.095146893	Higher temperatures would mean more rain falling rather than snow, compounding issues of water storage and potentially affecting flooding.
3_50	0.096742597	In some places, the new tensions and pressures could even push water users toward compromise.
3_51	0.10363913	Colorado recently hired a mediator to try to settle a long- running dispute over how water from the Rocky Mountains should be shared among users in the Denver area and the western half of the state.
3_52	0.13703774	Denver gets most of the water and has most of the state's population.
3_53	0.097053017	But water users in the mountains, notably the ski resort industry, also have clout and want to keep their share.
3_54	0.096942571	Robert W. Johnson, the Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, said he shared the optimism that the disputes could be worked out, but he said he thought it might take a reconsideration of the West's original conception of what water was for.
3_55	0.10572395	The great dams and reservoirs that were envisioned beginning in the 1800s were conceived with farmers in mind, and farmers still take about 90 percent of the Colorado River's flow.

5_1	0.32071985	Facing the worst drought in a century and the prospect that climate change could yield long-term changes on the Colorado River, the lifeline for several Western states, federal officials have reached a new pact with the states on how to allocate water if the river runs short.
5_2	0.30110823	State and federal officials praised the agreement, which Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was expected to sign Thursday, as a landmark akin to the Colorado River Compact of 1922 that first divvied up how much water the seven states served by the river -- California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming -- receive annually.
5_3	0.17651117	The new accord, outlined by federal officials in a telephone news conference Friday, spells out how three down-river states, California, Arizona and Nevada, will share the pain of river shortages.
5_4	0.20217293	It puts in place new measures to encourage conservation and manage the two primary reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which have gone from nearly full to just about half empty since 1999.
5_5	0.13365729	The accord is expected to forestall litigation that was likely to have arisen as fast-growing states jockey for the best way to keep the water flowing to their residents and businesses in increasingly dry times.
5_6	0.065415695	It would be in effect through 2026 and could be revised during that time.
5_7	0.064399875	Some environmental groups said the pact did not go far enough to encourage conservation and discourage growth.
5_8	0.11392316	But federal officials said they took the best of several proposals by the states, environmental organizations and others and emphasized the importance of all seven states agreeing with the result.
5_9	0.10089289	"I think for the first time in 85 years we are on the same page," said Herb Guenther, the director of water resources in Arizona, which had initially balked at some terms of the agreement and was threatening legal action over it.
5_10	0.11981851	But with water levels in reservoirs dropping, a record eight-year drought, the prospect that climate change could bring more dry spells and new scientific analyses suggesting the West could be drier than has been traditionally believed, the states were pushed to act.
5_11	0.078527262	These factors "forced the issue to the head and we decided to do something unique and different," Guenther said.
5_12	0.11603537	The agreement, the product of two-and-a-half years of negotiation and study, establishes criteria for the Interior Department to declare a shortage on the river, which would occur when the system is unable to produce the 7.5 million acre-feet of water, enough to supply 15 million homes for a year, that the three down river states are entitled to.
5_13	0.21551506	Water deliveries would be decreased based on how far water levels drop in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
5_14	0.11687758	The Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river system, predicts about a 5 percent chance of such a shortage being declared by 2010, but it all depends on how much the states are able to conserve and, of course, the weather.
5_15	0.099689705	The probability projection "does not imply it can't happen," said Terry Fulp, a bureau official involved in managing the river.
5_16	0.13110543	Water districts, anticipating an eventual cutback of Colorado River water, have been storing large amounts of water and the accord encourages them to continue to do so.
5_17	0.1352202	The pact includes a bundle of agreements with the states, including approval for water managers in the Las Vegas area, which gets 90 percent of its water from the Colorado, to get a greater share of Lake Mead water in exchange for financing a reservoir in California to capture large amounts of river water destined for Mexico but beyond that country's entitlement by treaty.
5_18	0.11395582	"It's hugely important for us," said Scott Huntley, a spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
5_19	0.098524091	"This really does provide the bridge for us to get into the next decade."
5_20	0.10873381	But John Weisheit, conservation director for Living Rivers, a Utah-based environmental group, said the agreement sends the message to the states that growth trumps sensible water management.
5_21	0.099653248	Weisheit said the conservation should have been stressed and the government's computer modeling was overly optimistic about future water supply.
5_22	0.098136367	"There is more water on paper than there actually is on the landscape," he said.
5_23	0.099235943	"They are looking at this in a way that will allow more development even though the water is not theoretically there."
6_0	0.15872252	The Colorado River Delta was once a watery labyrinth of willow thickets, mesquite and cottonwood, bigger than the state of Rhode Island and teeming with bird and animal life.
6_1	0.14983347	Today it is a barren expanse of salt-stained mudflats where the river used to meet the sea south of Yuma, Ariz.
6_2	0.27590915	About 90 percent of the delta's wetlands and natural habitat dried up over the past half century, as water from the Colorado was captured in reservoirs and diverted to farms and cities from Las Vegas to Mexicali, Mexico.
6_3	0.13710683	For more than a decade, conservation groups in the U.S. and Mexico have tried unsuccessfully to restore North America's largest desert estuary.
6_4	0.07479755	Now the Sonoran Institute is warning that unless restoration is undertaken before a prolonged dry spell, which many scientists are predicting, it could be too late.
6_5	0.082431953	In its forthcoming analysis of the delta, the nonprofit Arizona institute paints a dire picture of the once-vibrant ecosystem.
6_6	0.18184849	But it also puts forth a proposal for replenishing much of the area by replacing a fraction of the river water that once flowed through the delta, saying it would be enough to restore much of the area's natural wealth.
6_7	0.1844865	Under the institute's plan, the delta would get about three- tenths of a percent of the river's historic annual flow, making it one of the more modest claims on a river that serves 30 million people.
6_8	0.075564058	But even that amount could be a hard sell.
6_9	0.15346762	Eight years of drought in the Colorado watershed have raised the likelihood of shortages in the near future, and as officials in the U.S. and Mexico look for creative ways of limiting future cutbacks, every drop will count.
6_10	0.14205879	The river's annual flow has fallen as low as 25 percent of normal since 2000, and some scientists have predicted that with the growing influence of climate change, flows will average 50 percent to 60 percent of normal over the next 50 years.
6_11	0.18302227	Later this year, Interior Secretary Dick Kempthorne is expected to announce the first-ever guidelines for managing reduced water deliveries from the Colorado in the event of shortages.
6_12	0.17871203	Officials say a shortage will be declared when the water level at Lake Mead drops 36 feet below its current level, a change that is expected within the next few years.
6_13	0.090370679	As the government draws up plans for dealing with a reduced water supply, environmentalists believe restoration must be made a priority or the delta will be doomed.
6_14	0.080103034	"If we fail right now, we might really fail, as the shortage becomes a reality and discussions about saving water for conservation become a lot harder," said Jennifer Pitt, a policy analyst with the group Environmental Defense, which works closely with the Sonoran Institute.
6_15	0.089257763	Advocates for the delta have little legal leverage.
6_16	0.16427065	Neither the 1944 treaty that allocates Colorado River water to Mexico nor any environmental law in that country mandates water for the delta.
6_17	0.092928667	Late last year, in support of efforts by California to reclaim water that has been seeping across the border and nourishing crops and wetlands in the delta, Congress passed legislation barring the use of U.S. environmental laws to protect Mexico's interests.
6_18	0.10986995	But the Sonoran Institute contends that there is still nearly enough unclaimed water in the river to revive the delta without impinging on any existing rights on either side of the border.
6_19	0.08878178	"What we are talking about is the slop, leakage and waste discharges, " said Peter Culp, a lawyer who represents the institute.
6_20	0.11227586	It's the water that slips past Mexico's Morelos Dam after an upriver storm or that trickles back to the river from irrigated fields.
6_21	0.096632443	For 30 years, the crown jewel of the delta's remaining wetlands, the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara in Sonora, Mexico, has relied entirely on brackish discharges from a nearby irrigation district.
6_22	0.093274535	The problem with such releases, however, is that they can't be counted on forever and don't always occur when nature needs them.
6_23	0.11122999	To ensure timely flows, the institute has proposed amending the 1944 treaty to allow Mexico to bank water in the U.S. and participate in a bi-national water market.
6_24	0.099925963	"There are significant human benefits to the proposal," said Mark Lellouch, one of its authors.
6_25	0.096527252	About 200,000 people live in scattered communities in the delta, Lellouch said, and restoration would provide more sustenance and more jobs.
6_26	0.089343855	Even now, nature tourism is a going concern.
6_27	0.10057152	Visitors from the U.S. and Mexico are drawn to the Cienega de Santa Clara and other destinations by the estimated 350,000 birds that still nest and feed in the delta.
6_28	0.098044581	"There are a number of stakeholders in Mexico interested in that environment," said Steve Smullen, principal engineer for the International Boundary and Water Commission, the agency that administers water-rights treaties between the United States and Mexico.
6_29	0.10276145	But he said the institute's plan " works against agricultural interest, conservative interest and the interests of large communities" vying for the water .
6_30	0.097226449	"If there's enough will, you can make anything happen," he said.
6_31	0.08988354	"But it's an uphill battle."
7_0	0.34873664	The shortage guidelines, more than two years in the making, come in the eighth year of the worst drought in the century-long historic record of the Colorado, which supplies water to 25 million people and 1 million acres of farmland.
7_1	0.30582017	Federal water managers say a shortage could be declared as early as 2010, allowing the Department of the Interior to reduce water deliveries to Arizona and Nevada, two of the seven states that have sparred over the waterway for decades.
7_2	0.21341862	California, which has the biggest water allocation and seniority rights in the Lower Basin, would not be affected.
7_3	0.24692772	The ongoing drought has left Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the Colorado's two mammoth reservoirs, half empty, their receding shorelines marked by a wide band of bleached rocks that a decade ago were under water.
7_4	0.22411851	Without some very wet years, Lake Mead might never refill, according to federal hydrologists.
7_5	0.21404574	"We have had good news and bad news," said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne in a speech before signing the shortage document at the Colorado River Water Users Association meeting at Caesars Palace.
7_6	0.14243096	The bad news, he added, is that the Colorado drought shows "no sign of ending."
7_7	0.16825183	Scientists also predict that climate change will worsen Western drought patterns and reduce Colorado flows by increasing evaporation and decreasing snowfall.
7_8	0.077245519	One study released earlier in 2007 warned that global warming could thrust the Southwest into a state of permanent drought by 2050.
7_9	0.18933039	"Runoff in five of the seven Colorado River basin states is projected to decline by more than 15 percent during the 21st century," Kempthorne said.
7_10	0.16449749	Against that backdrop, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and California began negotiations in 2005 to write a blueprint for water shortages.
7_11	0.14688658	Their plans formed the basis of the document signed by Kempthorne, who called it "an agreement to share adversity" and a landmark in the tangled history of Colorado River management.
7_12	0.13530523	The agreement avoided a prolonged legal battle among the seven states by tinkering with river law without changing the fundamentals of the 1922 compact that divided the Colorado's flow among them.
7_13	0.18766029	Although California's seniority rights put it in the best position of the Lower Basin states, the agreement benefited the state by preventing "bloody legal fights in Congress or the courts," said Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
7_14	0.078918341	The guidelines, which will be in effect for the next 19 years, contain three major elements:
7_15	0.1436133	They set particular water-level elevations of Lake Mead as triggers for water cutbacks.
7_16	0.12749098	The reductions will total less than 10 percent of the Lower Basin's allocation.
7_17	0.092975676	Arizona agriculture will bear the brunt of the shortfall and Nevada a small portion of it.
7_18	0.08908591	"California is secure.
7_19	0.10118271	It's entitlement is not impacted," said Bill Swan, water rights attorney for the Imperial Irrigation District, which gets three-fourths of California's Colorado allotment.
7_20	0.20066913	Lake Powell, which holds water from the upper-basin states, and Lake Mead, which receives water from Powell, will be operated as one reservoir system.
7_21	0.12857937	That is expected to make it easier to control Mead's level and the shortage triggers.
7_22	0.09578182	States will be allowed to hold "conserved" water in Mead from year to year, changing existing rules that require them to use or lose their annual allocations.
7_23	0.099172299	Water agencies then could pay irrigation districts to let farmland lie fallow, keep the unused irrigation water stored in Mead and draw on it at a later date.
7_24	0.11213639	The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will be able to store up to 1.5 million acre-feet in Mead, nearly double the capacity of its Diamond Valley Lake Reservoir in Riverside County.
7_25	0.10649853	That is enough water to meet annual needs for about 3 million average households.
7_26	0.11537272	Nevada, which has the smallest water allotment in the Lower Basin, plans to hold water in Mead from fallow farmland along the Virgin and Muddy rivers.
7_27	0.10428637	The Southern Nevada Water Authority also will build a small reservoir, called Drop Two, near the Mexican border to capture flows ordered by U.S. farmers who don't use it during rain.
7_28	0.11173339	That measure would decrease flows to the Colorado's ecologically important delta, potentially sparking outcry from Mexico.
7_29	0.11204859	In return for financing the reservoir, Southern Nevada will get some of the captured water.
7_30	0.10054851	Metropolitan and Arizona also might take part in the arrangement.
7_31	0.10088273	Las Vegas' exploding population and growing water needs have been a driving force behind the state talks.
7_32	0.1146639	Pat Mulroy, head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, had threatened to go to court to get more water.
7_33	0.098201209	Michael Cohen, senior associate for the Pacific Institute, called the agreement a large step forward.
7_34	0.12020594	But he wasn't prepared to say the states that rely on the Colorado River have fully acknowledged a drier future.
7_35	0.098914548	"None of the municipal agencies are saying, `We need to re- evaluate our urban plans, our growth plans because there's only so much water,' " he said.
7_36	0.099524848	"It's not clear that the states are saying, `OK, we're going to now live in this era of limits.' "

8_12	0.12384947	His company is working around the clock, drilling wells to irrigate fields in California's 400-mile-long Central Valley, one of the most productive food-growing areas in the world.
8_13	0.066821097	``People are really starting to panic for water," said Arthur, whose father started drilling wells in 1959.
8_14	0.04193485	They must drill ever deeper to tap the sinking water table.
8_15	0.081284982	``Eventually, the water will be so deep the farmers won't be able to afford to pump it," he said.

8_20	0.097912717	At Stanford University, 170 miles away, Stephen Schneider, editor of the journal Climatic Change and a lead author for the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), pours himself a cup of tea and says the future is clear.
8_21	0.18384937	``As the air gets warmer, there will be more water in the atmosphere.
8_22	0.07275985	That's settled science," he said.
8_23	0.046663097	But where, and when, it comes down is the big uncertainty.
8_24	0.07795087	``You are going to intensify the hydrologic cycle.
8_25	0.083102939	Where the atmosphere is configured to have high pressure and droughts, global warming will mean long, dry periods.
8_26	0.055095001	Where the atmosphere is configured to be wet, you will get more rain, more gully washers.
8_27	0.098589987	``Global warming will intensify drought," he says.
8_28	0.084966512	``And it will intensify floods."
8_29	0.086332212	According to the IPCC, that means a drying out of areas such as southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, South Australia, Patagonia and the U.S. Southwest.
8_30	0.083048032	These will not be small droughts.
8_31	0.089843975	Richard Seager, a senior researcher at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, looked at 19 computer models of the future under current global warming trends.
8_32	0.10277508	He found remarkable consistency: Sometime before 2050, the models predicted, the Southwest will be gripped in a dry spell akin to the Dust Bowl drought, which lasted through most of the 1930s.
8_33	0.077016114	The spacing of tree rings suggests numerous periods of drought going back to A.D. 800, he said.
8_34	0.086001288	But, ``mechanistically, this is different.
8_35	0.071303841	These projections clearly come from a warming forced by rising greenhouse gases."
8_36	0.089228352	Farmers in the Central Valley, where a quilt of lush, green orchards on brown hills displays the alchemy of irrigation, want to believe this is a passing dry spell.
8_37	0.11144082	They thought a wet 2006 ended a seven-year drought, but this year is one of the driest on record.
8_38	0.13717353	For the first time, state water authorities shut off irrigation pumps to large parts of the valley, forcing farmers to dig wells.
8_39	0.12809749	Farther south and east, the once-mighty Colorado River is looking sickly, siphoned by seven states before dribbling into Mexico.
8_40	0.17813299	Its reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are drying, leaving accusatory rings on the shorelines and imperiling river-rafting companies.
8_41	0.093902504	Seager predicts that drought will prompt dislocations similar to those of the Dust Bowl.
8_42	0.091240125	``It will certainly cause movements of people.
