2_0	0.56681636	Of the 10 cats and dogs whose deaths have been linked to pet food that was recalled over the weekend, seven died last month in a taste test conducted by the manufacturer, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday.
2_1	0.39661344	The company, Menu Foods of Streetsville, Ontario, started testing its product on 40 to 50 animals on Feb. 27, one week after it began hearing from owners who said the food had made their pets ill, said Stephen Sundlof, director of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine.

2_16	0.16874235	Sundlof urged people who think their pet might have been affected to contact their local FDA office and a veterinarian if a pet exhibits symptoms of kidney failure, which include lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting.
