0_1	0.4583333333333333	With the threat looming of a grand jury inquest into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the parents of the murdered beauty princess Thursday completed three days of questioning by prosecutors here, breaking their 16 months of official silence.
0_2	0.8	John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney.

0_8	0.375	Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand jury.
0_9	0.75	A new grand jury was impaneled here two months ago.
0_10	0.1	Early this month, Boulder police spent two days detailing the case to Hunter.

0_16	0.0	At the same time, Beckner said he was ``excited'' about new evidence.

0_21	0.0	So far, the investigation has cost this small city $1 million in additional police and prosecution expenses.

0_27	0.42857142857142855	``You only use a grand jury to compel evidence: testimony or documents,'' said Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who is now a defense attorney.

1_21	0.21052631578947367	Haddon, the Ramsey attorney, said the family's communication with the district attorney actually began over a year ago and included handing over records regarding medical, phone, bank and business matters.
