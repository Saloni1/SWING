0_0	0.0	The Clinton administration announced a new privacy initiative Friday aimed at protecting children and medical patients, among others.
0_1	0.0	But while the proposals were ambitious, the administration can enforce few of them without the consent of Congress or private industry.
0_2	0.03571428571428571	Calling privacy in the age of electronic commerce ``a basic American value'' that ``must be protected,'' Vice President Al Gore made public a list of a dozen or so new initiatives that seek to tighten the security of financial and medical records and to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet.
0_3	0.0	Many of the proposals are simply endorsements of bills already wending their way through Congress.
0_4	0.0	Others require new congressional action that is, in some cases, uncertain at best.
0_5	0.0	But the administration chose not to offer any broad new ideas for protecting the privacy of adults online, an issue important to many in Congress and to public-interest groups.
0_6	0.0	Gore announced instead that, for now, the administration would leave industry to regulate itself.
0_7	0.0	The government's privacy rules are of special concern now because the European Union plans to enforce a new electronic privacy program in October and has threatened to stop doing business with companies in other countries that have looser rules.
0_8	0.0	In congressional testimony earlier this week, Commerce Secretary William Daley said the administration's new proposals would bring the United States into compliance.
0_9	0.0	But some experts in privacy law disagree.
0_10	0.07692307692307693	The administration can enforce only a handful of the initiatives proposed Friday, including two that would tighten the security of medical and banking records.
0_11	0.058823529411764705	The White House said the Department of Health and Human Services would propose a new rule next week to enhance the security of electronic medical records, but offered no details.
0_12	0.0	And federal bank regulators will strengthen the enforcement of a law that sets limits on how easily banks can share information about their customers and their accounts with related business, such as insurance companies, according to a senior administration official.
0_13	0.0	The goal, Gore said, was ``to ensure that account-holders have the chance to give a thumbs-down or a thumbs-up before banks hand out sensitive information about their accounts.''
0_14	0.0	Many of the other proposals are just that _ ideas that are up to others to implement.
0_15	0.0	For example, Gore said he wanted to discourage ``profiling'' _ the practice by some companies of building dossiers on the activities of private citizens using a variety of databases and then using or selling that information to other businesses.
0_16	0.0	``We are working with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a new challenge to companies that use information technology to piece together personal profiles of American citizens and then sell those profiles for profit,'' the vice president said.
0_17	0.0	``And here is the message to them: If you don't find a way quickly to effectively regulate your own industry, we will take actions to make you protect the privacy of all Americans.''
0_18	0.8	Similarly, the White House urged Congress to pass pending legislation that would enforce criminal penalties for ``identity theft'' _ stealing someone's Social Security number, credit-card numbers or other identifiers and using them to commit a crime, such as credit-card fraud.
0_19	0.0	Gore also urged Congress to pass a law that would forbid companies running sites on the World Wide Web to collect information about children under 13 visiting the sites without permission from their parents.
0_20	0.3	``Before children innocently forfeit personal information, parents should have a say,'' the vice president said.
