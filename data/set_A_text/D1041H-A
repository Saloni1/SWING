3_0	0.7894736842105263	More than 58 percent of world coral reefs have been threatened by human pressure and weather change, said an press release issued on Saturday by a world conservation meeting held here.
3_1	0.09523809523809523	"With so many reefs endangered, efforts to save corals could be overlooked," Carl Gustaf Lundin, Head of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Marine Program was quoted by the press release as saying.
3_2	0.6	IUCN on Friday launched a report named "2004 Status of Coral Reefs of the World" at the 3rd World Conservation Conference, which is being held in Bangkok from Nov. 17 to Nov. 25.
3_3	0.3	The report warned that the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
3_4	0.7142857142857143	"Reefs provide seafood for one billion people in Asia alone, many of them from poor communities.
3_5	0.36363636363636365	Reef-based activities, principally fishing and tourism, provide economic livelihoods for millions of others," said the IUCN press release.
3_6	1.5555555555555556	Besides human impact, coral reefs are also threatened by global weather change.
3_7	0.9411764705882353	In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs, a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years.
3_8	0.0	However, "the extreme events of 1998 will become more common in the next 50 years," with increasing sea surface temperatures and other factors.
3_9	0.0	"Massive global bleaching mortality will not be a 1/1000 year event in the future, but a regular event," warned the release.
3_10	0.07142857142857142	It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.
3_11	0.0	In south Asia, over 60 percent of the reefs were killed during the 1998 mass bleaching, and today almost half of the reefs remain dead.
3_12	0.07142857142857142	Even in the higher diversity areas of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, there are few encouraging signs for reefs for increasing human pressures.

4_0	1.5714285714285714	For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
4_1	0.0	Some reefs, however, are proving surprisingly resilient, researchers say, not because of qualities of the corals, but because of heat-tolerant algae that live with them.
4_2	0.0	It may even be possible that heat-related episodes of coral bleaching, which had been viewed as ominous previews of mass coral death to come, could allow these robust algae to spread, leaving corals better able to survive in a warmer world.
4_3	1.375	The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
4_4	0.0	But if the findings hold up, "they essentially buy us time" to address those issues, said Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society, who led the new work.
4_5	0.0	Algae and corals live in a symbiotic relationship.
4_6	0.0	Coral polyps absorb and shelter the algae, and as the algae photosynthesize they produce sugars that the corals use for energy.
4_7	0.0	But this relationship can falter when ocean water warms, Baker said.
4_8	0.0	"Basically, algae cells are lost from the coral host," he said.
4_9	0.07692307692307693	"We don't know if it's the algae leaving a sick coral colony or a coral ejecting a defunct algae.
4_10	0.0	I suspect it's a bit of both."
4_11	0.0	The result is coral bereft of much of its power supply.
4_12	0.6875	The living polyps that give coral reefs their color wither, usually leaving lifeless white skeleton reefs of calcium carbonate.
4_13	0.0	It is as if the reefs have been bleached.
4_14	0.0	But the new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae may move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events.
4_15	0.0	If so, he said, "some of the doom and gloom might not be as bad as had been suggested."
4_16	0.0	The findings are "definitely good news," said Nancy Knowlton, an expert on corals who directs the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.
4_17	0.0	Baker and his colleagues studied corals affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation events, natural disruptions of ocean currents that occur periodically and that can cause ocean temperatures to rise in one area or another.
4_18	0.06666666666666667	In particular, they studied what happened to corals in relatively shallow waters off the Pacific coast of Panama, and in the Indian Ocean off Kenya and Mauritius.
4_19	0.0	All the corals they studied were colonized by Symbiodinium algae, a diverse genus whose various species look alike but react differently to heat.
4_20	0.4074074074074074	Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
4_21	0.0	The scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had experienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions of a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D. By contrast, reefs off Mauritius, where waters remained cooler, had fewer symbiont D algae.
4_22	0.0	They resembled the reefs of the Red Sea, Baker said.
4_23	0.0	Baker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August, suggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event, heat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them.
4_24	0.0	Symbiont D "is becoming more common on reefs that are experiencing bleaching events," Baker said.
4_25	0.0	He said the findings were the first "real-world evidence" that corals might adapt to warming.
4_26	0.0	But this kind of adaptation may not be enough "to let corals off the hook," as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.
4_27	0.7	For example, according to a report issued this month by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what conditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.
4_28	0.0	They do not even know if changes occur when corals recruit different algae from the water around them, or if something somehow changes the ratio of algae strains growing within them.
4_29	0.0	Also, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized with new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with other strains.
4_30	0.0	For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to providing sustenance to their coral hosts.
4_31	0.75	And though symbiont D is widespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not know whether all of them can support the strain.
4_32	0.0	Answers to those questions await more research, and she said the study of corals was still developing.
4_33	0.0	"If it were birds it would be 18th- or 19th-century science -- who's living with whom, where," she said.
4_34	0.3888888888888889	History suggests that the coral bleaching and mortality associated with the severe El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 was a thousand-year event, according to the monitoring network's coral report.
4_35	0.0	That means, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar effects would be seen in a given year.
4_36	0.13333333333333333	But, the report says, evidence strongly suggests that global warming will turn severe bleaching into "a regular event" by the middle of the century.
4_37	0.0	So evidence of coral recovery since 1998 is encouraging, the report says.
4_38	0.07692307692307693	"Some people would argue that global climate change is their biggest long-term threat," Knowlton said, "and it's the one we have the least ability to do anything about.
4_39	0.3333333333333333	So good news on the global warming front is very welcome."
4_40	0.15384615384615385	About half the reefs that were left badly damaged after the 1997-98 El Nino event have bounced back, Baker said.
4_41	0.0	"So even from a major event there can be recovery," he said, if overfishing, habitat destruction and other threats are mitigated.
4_42	0.0	"But there can't be recovery if we triple- and quadruple-whammy these reefs."

9_0	0.55	Members of the Taiwanese Coral Reef Society environmental group appealed yet again Friday to government agencies not to let the "Amorgos" pollution case go any further and see to it that the undersea wreckage is removed at the earliest possible date.
9_1	0.0	Wreckage of the Amorgos, a Greek freighter that ran aground and sank off the coast of Kenting at the southernmost tip of Taiwan Jan. 14, 2001, is now "a slaughter hell" for coral in an area of Lungkeng off Kenting, said Cheng Ming-hsiu, Society chairman and a researcher with Academia Sinica's Institute of Zoology.
9_2	0.0	Since the freighter's sinking, its wreckage has continued to impair the growth of coral because of the sharp metal edges of the wreck, turning the area into a coral graveyard, Cheng claimed.
9_3	0.6111111111111112	He added that after a series of observations, it has been found that in a 2 km by 500 meter coral reef area near Lungkeng, Kenting, coral coverage rate has continued to drop.
9_4	0.0	Contrary to previous speculation that the freighter's wreckage could become an undersea artificial fishery reef, he said, the ship has disintegrated in the strong currents and its debris has continued to spread, posing increasing threats to the coral.
9_5	0.0	The harmful debris will not disappear by itself and it cannot be "digested" by the sea, Cheng argued, adding that the only option is to have it removed before more coral, the ecological system and Taiwan's tourism resources are further compromised.
9_6	0.06666666666666667	A similar situation has been found in an undersea area to the east of Green Island, where the freighter Picasso sank 12 years ago, Cheng said.
9_7	0.7333333333333333	By comparison, he said, coral reefs near Penghu Island are found to be the most healthy, with coral coverage rate totaling nearly 100 percent.
9_8	0.0	The Amorgos, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, was heading for Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed mechanical problems and began to drift.
9_9	0.0	It ran aground 1.6 km off the coast of Oluanpi, Taiwan's southernmost tip, before sinking.
9_10	0.5	All 25 crew members were rescued, but the ship later broke in two and an estimated 1,150 tons of fuel oil gushed out of the vessel and blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area.
9_11	0.6875	The oil spill has blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area, causing an ecological disaster that will take the sensitive ecosystem years from which to recover.
9_12	0.0	At least three officials were disciplined due to aftermath of that incident.
