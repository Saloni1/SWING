<P>
Here is a list of stop words that have been compiled through the WWW.
Some of these are public, some are not.  Please make sure that the
private ones are not leaked outside rpnlpir / SoC.  Thanks!

<P>The files are organized in the original source form and then a
version that is processed into a "word per line" form (which is the
<CODE>.txt</CODE> file).

<P>N.B. currently (Wed May 28 10:50:48 GMT-8 2003) these files are all
for the English language.

  <LI> A stoplist from DCS, Glasgow, UK.  Probably from the van Rijsbergen book.  [public, filename: dcs-gla-ac-uk]
  <LI> A stoplist from versuslaw.com.  Saved from the web at <A HREF="http://www.versuslaw.com/help/search/printablestop.asp">http://www.versuslaw.com/help/search/printablestop.asp</A>.  Probably proprietary.  [private, filename: versuslaw]

<P>It is relatively easy to construct your own stop word list.  You
can either take the approach of stopping high frequency words or
closed-class words.  Either way gives you a candidate stop list to
start from.
